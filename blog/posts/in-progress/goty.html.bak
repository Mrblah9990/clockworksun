    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celeste is a great game. That's it; that's the review. You can go home now.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... No, of course we're not done here.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celeste is a 2D platformer of the sort you might recognize if you've played Super Meat Boy or other similar sorts of challenging, precise platformers with a heavy emphasis on momentum and an expectation that you will die a lot. The game tells the story of Madeline, a troubled young woman fighting anxiety and depression, and her journey to climb Celeste Mountain. To keep this post from rambling too much, I'm going to organize it into three distinct sections: gameplay, story, and presentation. Let's get started by talking about Celeste's gameplay.</p>

    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celeste's gameplay is heavily based on precision and momentum. Madeline's moveset for most of the game consists of a Mario-style jump (where the height varies with the duration of the button press), a fixed-length air dash that can be executed in any of the eight orthogonal directions, wall jumps that do not consume stamina, and the ability to climb and cling onto walls until stamina runs out. Each level works with these mechanics to produce a small puzzle to figure out what combination of moves will create the right momentum to clear the obstacles, then a skill-based challenge to see if you can actually pull it off.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mechanics really shine when paired with levels that focus on maintaining momentum and chaining jumps, dashes, wall jumps, and chapter-specific gimmicks (anything from pinball bumpers to bouncy clouds to celestial blocks that you can dash through) to get Madeline from one end of the room to the other in one fluid dance. It's a ton of fun to fling Madeline all over the level, getting a little bit farther with each try, until that final attempt when everything goes perfectly and you feel like a god as she just barely manages to grab the last ledge and clamber up to safety. </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major collectibles in Celeste are strawberries. There are usually a few dozen of these scattered throughout each chapter, some requiring complex acrobatics to grab and some hiding in secret locations. Trying to collect all 175 (ish) strawberries in the game is another fun challenge for the advanced player, but it's not required to beat the game or even to get the "best ending." Most of the secrets can be found just by poking around suspicious-looking places and replaying the level a lot, but there were a few I had to look up as they were hidden out of view off the wrong side of the screen or in similar places.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other major collectibles are crystal hearts. These take a lot more effort to find than any given strawberry, usually requiring several minutes of setup before even finding the heart, let alone collecting it. There is one heart in every level, and these are needed to unlock additional levels after the epilogue. Hearts in B-sides and C-sides (explained below) are always located at the end of the level, meaning you don't have to go out of your way to find them, unlike in regular levels.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hidden in each normal level is a secret B-side cassette tape that unlocks that level's B-side, an extremely challenging remix of the main level. Completing any B-side isn't required to beat the game, but each one will award a crystal heart, useful for unlocking post-epilogue content. These levels are shorter than the main ones but much more difficult. I usually died 2-4 times more on a level's B-side than its corresponding main level, though it took around the same time the first time through. C-sides are even harder levels, only three screens in length, unlocked after completing every B-side. These don't take as long as B-sides, just because they're so short, but I still died nearly as much as each corresponding B-side. These bonus levels can be frustrating at times, but the rush of completing them is so worth it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To wrap up the gameplay section, I'd like to mention Celeste's Assist Mode. This is an optional gameplay modifier that allows players to slow down the game speed, enable additional air dashes, or even make Madeline completely invincible. I didn't use this mode because Celeste's difficulty is an important component of the game, but I appreciate the developers making the game accessible to those who can't react as fast as they used to, or those who just want to enjoy the story but can't handle the gameplay. There's no penalty for using assist mode; no levels or collectibles are locked, and even achievements are still obtainable. If you want to enjoy Celeste but need a little extra help to do so, Assist Mode has you covered.</p>
    <h3>Story</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celeste has a small cast of characters, including Madeline the troubled protagonist and aspiring mountain climber, Theo the InstaPix star with his own share of issues, Mr Oshiro the ghostly proprieter of the Celestial Resort Hotel, Granny the kooky old woman who lives on the Mountain, and Badeline, who is referred to as Part of You in game and is a portion of Madeline given a body by the Mountain's power. Most of the characterization is afforded to Madeline and Badeline, as the game's story is their story, though each character does get enough screen time to have a believable and consistent personality. To save space, I'll mostly be talking about Madeline and Badeline, leaving Granny and Oshiro to the side for the most part.</p>
