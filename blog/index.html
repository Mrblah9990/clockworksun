                    <p class="w3-margin-right w3-text-gray">Well, most of those questions can be answered in the <a href="about">About Me</a> and <a href="about-site">About This Site</a> links in the navigation bar up top. I'm just a home screen; don't expect too much detail from me.<br>But to be brief, the answers in order are:

                            <li>This website is here to serve as a place to put things I make so I and others can easily find them.</li>
                            <li>The quote up top doesn't really mean anything; I thought it up on the spot when I realized I wanted a subtitle.</li>
                            <li>Hi, I'm Shaun and I have a website because I thought it would be fun and a good way to learn things.</li>
                            <li>What's all this then? Interesting, I hope.</li>

This website is self-hosted on a server I could kick as I'm writing this if I wanted to (don't worry, I won't). I work in my University's IT department, I write code, I use Linux sometimes. I like technology. If you want to hear more about my setup and what I think about technology, the <a href="tech">Tech</a> tab on the navigation bar has got you covered.</h5>
