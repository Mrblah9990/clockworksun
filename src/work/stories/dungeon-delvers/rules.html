                <h1 class="tx-hammer">Choices and Challenges</h1>
                
                <p><strong>Choices</strong> and <strong>Challenges</strong> differ in that choices are resolved without rolling any dice (no random chance) while challenges do rely, at least partially, on luck. Challenges will not be indicated any differently in the option text, but should generally be obvious as options with a chance to fail.</p>
                <p>The outcome of a challenge is determined by several factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>Difficulty Class (DC)</strong> of the challenge</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Suitability</strong> of the lead character attempting the challenge</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Suitability</strong> of the support character assisting</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Energy</strong> level of the lead character</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Difficulty Class</h4>
                <p>The DC of a challenge depends on how hard it is to succeed, and is a set of three numbers. When rolling the dice to resolve a challenge, a character who rolls above the <strong>success threshold</strong> succeeds and does not lose energy or health. A character who rolls between the success threshold and the <strong>damage threshold</strong> succeeds, but loses a point of energy. A character who rolls between the damage threshold and the <strong>failure threshold</strong> succeeds, but loses a point of health (and potentially energy). A character who rolls below the failure threshold fails, and may lose energy or health as well.</p>
                <p>In linear form: &lt;- Success [ST] Lose energy [DT] Lose health [FT] Fail -&gt;</p>
                <p>Quirks, bonuses, items, and other situational effects may cause a character to lose or maintain their health or energy even when their roll would normally indicate otherwise.</p>

                <h4>Suitability</h4>
                <p>The Suitability of a character, whether lead or support, depends on their stat or stats that most closely match the challenge. Each stat has a general set of challenges that it excels in. Note that the following list is not exhaustive and is just a series of examples.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strength - pushing, carrying, physical combat</li>
                    <li>Dexterity - balancing, disarming traps, ranged combat</li>
                    <li>Magic - countering magical traps, casting spells, magical combat</li>
                    <li>Charm - convincing, performing, bluffing</li>
                    <li>Insight - perceiving, investigating, recalling knowledge</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Quirks, bonuses, items, and other situational advantages can also play into a character's Suitability. A character with high Suitability for a challenge gains a bonus to their roll.</p>

                <h4>Energy</h4>
                <p>If a character's Energy level is low, they will receive a penalty to their roll. The penalty depends on the situation</p>
