(2) The Factory <img class="emoji " alt="🏭" title="🏭" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f3ed.png" /> 
Horror
Near-future - Industrial Facility
Kidnapped by mysterious shadowed figures, our protagonist wakes up in a long concrete tunnel, a small hole cut from the ceiling and a painful collection of bruises the only clues as to how they got there. Pipes line the walls and the hum of distant machinery presses heavily on the senses. Where are they, and how do they escape?

(2) A Dream of the Void <img class="emoji " alt="🛏" title="🛏" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f6cf.png" /> 
Atmospheric / Cosmic Intrigue
The Dream Realm
You were once a normal person living a normal life. That all changed when you fell asleep one night under the baleful glare of a demon star and woke into a dream more real than ever before. The ravenous ocean is calling to you, as is the burning sun and the unknowable void. Which call do you heed, if any? Is there a fourth path, a way to choose another option? What is actually happening in this dream?

Mystery / Horror
Present Day - Moderately sized city
Our protagonist has accidentally discovered signs of a strange new cult operating nearby, with the apparent goal of summoning... something. Beyond a few scattered disappearances and a tattered manuscript fished out of the river, there’s little evidence this cult even exists: certainly not enough for the law to go on. However, our protagonist has had a brush with magic once before and knows enough to take the threat very seriously indeed. There isn’t much time, though, as the ancient day of Candlemas - one of the best times to hold rituals - approaches quickly.

Action-Adventure
Space - Kronwa&#235;
The recent mysterious disappearance of several high-profile starliners, and one isolated planet, has thrown the local sector into a frenzy. Government agents, adventurers, mercenaries, and corporation employees are all out searching for the cause of these disappearances. Our protagonist is one of these searchers, and they think they’re onto something...

                            <span class="markdown">The next scenario will be <em>Those that Lie Sleeping</em>! Before we get started, though, there are a few choices that need to be made. Please vote for each category.

Will the story be told in second or third person?
<img class="emoji " alt="2⃣" title="2⃣" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/32-20e3.png" /> - Second person
<img class="emoji " alt="3⃣" title="3⃣" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/33-20e3.png" /> - Third person

Where will the story take place?
<img class="emoji " alt="🏘" title="🏘" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f3d8.png" /> - The New England countryside, near the ever-haunted city of Arkham. A classic Lovecraftian setting.
<img class="emoji " alt="🏙" title="🏙" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f3d9.png" /> - A large city, perhaps in the midwest. An urban, more modern setting.
<img class="emoji " alt="🗺" title="🗺" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f5fa.png" /> - A rural area, maybe in the plains down the center of the US. A modern but isolated setting.

Who is our protagonist?
<img class="emoji " alt="👮" title="👮" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f46e.png" /> - Dave, a relatively new police officer to the force on the hunt for crooks, criminals, or whatever else lies at the bottom of this mystery.
<img class="emoji " alt="🎓" title="🎓" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f393.png" /> - Andrew, an associate professor of mathematics at the local university, well versed in academics and with the backing of the school.
<img class="emoji " alt="📷" title="📷" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4f7.png" /> - Cass, an intrepid journalist determined to capture a great story and acquainted with one of the vanished victims.

How do you want to handle matters of chance?
<img class="emoji " alt="🎲" title="🎲" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f3b2.png" /> - Continue as is; spoilered probability, use chance for certain options.
<img class="emoji " alt="⛔" title="⛔" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/26d4.png" /> - Remove all chance. All choices have a pre-determined outcome.
<img class="emoji " alt="🕶" title="🕶" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f576.png" /> - Keep chance, but completely hide the probabilities.

Cass slowly drifted into consciousness, her mind drifting in the wind much like the flakes of ash that were covering her like a blanket. The floor creaked as she groaned and pushed her aching body off the floor, shuffling to the side in order to prop herself up against the flame-scorched wall. <em>Fuck,</em> she thought. <em>What the hell happened here?</em>

She closed her eyes to fight the sudden wave of nausea and searched her memories for any clues. The previous night was fragmented, with some pieces lost. She had been drinking with Ben, that much was sure. They had been swapping tales and pieces of evidence regarding the cult. Then... no good. There was a lapse, right after Ben had slammed a binder full of articles onto the table. The sound of glass breaking, then nothing but void until the morning. Had she dropped her glass? Had someone broken a window? Her memories alone weren’t enough to tell her. Obviously there had been a fire. 

Out of Cass’s scrambled brain rose an urgent thought that forced her eyes open to quickly search the room. Where was Ben? The burned kitchen left no clues - the floor was coated in ash, the walls scorched black up to the ceiling, and the chairs and stools nothing more than charred kindling. Cass grasped the wall and swayed, choking back her nausea. Ben was nowhere to be seen. The apartment wasn’t large; he had to be here somewhere!

What will Cass do? 
<img class="emoji " alt="🥞" title="🥞" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f95e.png" /> - Investigate the kitchen and table for signs of broken glass or Ben.
<img class="emoji " alt="🚬" title="🚬" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f6ac.png" /> - Investigate the ash and the fire markings.
<img class="emoji " alt="📷" title="📷" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4f7.png" /> - Investigate herself; check for injuries or any other problems. Try to get rid of this damn nausea.
<img class="emoji " alt="🛋" title="🛋" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f6cb.png" /> - Enter the living room, look around.
<img class="emoji " alt="🚪" title="🚪" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f6aa.png" /> - Exit the apartment.

Cass couldn’t quite believe she was unharmed after whatever had happened here. She took a few minutes to let the nausea subside while feeling along her limbs for any cuts, breaks, or burns. Nothing immediately obvious presented itself aside from a sort of widespread tingling that made Cass more and more nervous the longer it lasted. Everything still moved; nothing felt injured. <em>Did I really just drink that much? It didn’t seem like it at the time.</em> 

After a few more moments of recuperating on the floor, Cass finally risked standing up and stumbling over to the small mirror Ben had on his fridge. “So you can see when you’ve had enough,” he had said. Cass wasn’t sure it worked like that, but she took the opportunity to check her reflection and see if anything looked out of place. Her face was a mess, sweaty and flushed and with her hair sticking up on one side where she had been lying on the floor. Beyond that, though, nothing looked wro... wait. 

Cass leaned closer and pulled down her collar to better take a look her her lower neck. The nausea returned in a wave as she saw two small red punctures just above her collarbone. They were maybe two fingers-widths apart and resembled marks from a needle. There was a slight amount of dried blood surrounding each wound.

                            <span class="markdown">Cass doubled over and pressed her forehead against the refrigerator, her mind going blank. Several seconds passed before the nausea subsided somewhat and she felt able to stand again. <em>Okay, I&#39;m starting to freak out a little. That’s fine. To be expected, really. I don’t know if I’ve been poisoned, or bitten by a vampire, or something equally crazy. Just stay calm. Once I find Ben, we can both get help.</em>

The tingling is getting worse, but at least the nausea is going away. What will Cass do now?

Cass reached into her pocket to pull out her phone and just call Ben. Maybe he was doing fine somewhere else, or at least she would be able to trace the sound to his location. With a shaky breath, Cass removed her hands from her pockets. They were empty. No phone, wallet, keys, or anything else. She supposed it was technically still possible for all of this to have just been a very bad night of drinking, but it would have been orders of magnitude worse than any bad nights she had suffered before. 

On shaky legs, Cass stepped away from the fridge to investigate the rest of the room. The small kitchen table was charred on the edges, but the heavy tablecloth had protected its center from the worst of the flames. On a hunch, Cass flipped it up to look underneath, revealing a dark red-brown stain. She shivered and brought a hand to her neck. The wine they had been drinking wasn’t that color; it was certainly blood. Hers? 

Both wine glasses were on the floor, shattered and partially melted. Cass was momentarily relieved by the possible explanation for the shattering sounds, but those hopes were quickly dashed when she pulled apart the front window curtains and saw the pane shattered and lying in pieces on the floor. What made this all the more puzzling was the fact that the apartment was on the second floor. The day outside was grey and drizzly. Occasional pedestrians hurried by, though few cars passed through this narrow street. Who would bother to break a window, especially with no thrown object in sight that could have caused the damage?

Cass leaned against the wall, her head spinning and limbs prickling. She groaned and nearly slid back down to sit on the floor. What now?

<em>Breathe in, breathe out. You can handle this.</em> Cass hesitantly stepped away from the wall to take a closer look at the ash and scorch marks from the fire. The ash was spread all over the room, though it had mostly piled into the corner where she had woken up, possibly due to a draft from the window. It was in the right direction, at least. Beyond the ash, Cass tried to trace the scorch marks to see where the fire may have started. 

The ceiling, though mostly untouched by the flames, had one charred section just above a particular location on the counter where the plastic top was melted and warped. Flakes of light ash drifted along the counter and as Cass looked closer, she saw they were burnt fragments of paper, unlike the rest of the ash. Whoever set the fire must have burned a pile of papers on the counter. That meant the fire had to have been intentional. Probably. 

Cass gritted her teeth as her vision flashed, her sight crowded out by static-like images matching the tingles in her limbs. The wave slowly receded and she gasped for the breath she didn’t know she had been holding. Those must have been Ben’s notes on the cult; that was the only large set of papers in the kitchen. She leaned on the counter, shivering. What now?

Cass entered the living room and looked around. Nothing was burnt in here, but flakes of ash had drifted in from the kitchen. The TV, couch, and desk in the corner all looked untouched from the previous night. A trail of ashen footprints led from the kitchen into the bedroom. The door sagged open, half-drooping from its hinges. All was quiet. Cass stepped forwards, heart pounding at what she would find in the bedroom. Visions of Ben, lying dead in a pool of blood, flashed into her mind and she shook her head, trying to stay optimistic. Two more steps and she could see into the room. One more. 

On the last step, Cass tripped and fell forward, her legs seeming to turn to jelly. She crashed into the carpet, hard, and blacked out.

...

Cass floated in an ocean of impossibly clear waves. Aurora danced above her, while a starry void yawned beneath her. The water was warm, calming, pleasant. Aside from a slight itch near her neck, Cass felt fine. She floated for a while, drifting where the currents took her. The itch grew, then started to become painful. Nervously, Cass moved her head to look. 

Golden light poured from the two wounds in her neck, shining into space. Her skin felt hot and tight near the punctures and Cass nervously covered the light with her hands, warily looking to the sky for anything that might be seeking it. The aurora shone on, uncaring. The night wore on. Eventually, Cass dropped her hands and allowed the light to pour out. It offered some relief from the pain, and after a while the warmth grew comfortable.

Lights appeared in the distance, a city skyline at night. Cass was drifting towards the shore, though she was unsure how far it was or if distance even mattered. Something splashed into the water behind her. 

<img class="emoji " alt="↩" title="↩" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/21a9.png" /> - Turn and look.
<img class="emoji " alt="🌆" title="🌆" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f306.png" /> - Ignore the splash. Drift towards the city. It looks familiar...

Cass swiveled in the water as she tried to turn as quickly as possible. Water splashed and she nearly went under before getting herself re-oriented. The light from her neck illuminated the water for a fair distance, revealing a small dark green creature, about the size of a large basketball and nearly as round, only a few feet away and momentarily dazzled by the light. Cass swallowed uneasily and started gliding slowly backwards, retreating towards the distant city. The creature had beady yellow eyes with vertical pupils and a wide mouth filled with jagged teeth. Almost comically small pectoral, dorsal, and tail fins fluttered rapidly. A slow-pulsing blue light on its head drew Cass’s attention. Such an unusual shade...

Suddenly, the thing uncurled, blinked, and darted forward. Cass lost sight of it for a moment as it darted around behind her, orders of magnitude faster and more agile in the water than she was. It reappeared off to her right and Cass gasped, clutching her side in pain as blood spilled into the water from a thin cut she hadn’t even seen it inflict. She kicked at the fish but it easily dodged and lunged up and out of the water, its powerful jaws biting into the skin surrounding the wounds in her neck.

It was just a dream,</em> she told herself, an unpleasantly sticky feeling on her fingers undercutting her certainty. A quick rush back to the mirror in the kitchen confirmed it; she was bleeding lightly from a thin, shallow cut just above her waist. A set of similarly shallow bite marks surrounded the two puncture wounds from before. A quick count showed 24 individual teeth, each surrounded by fresh blood but seeming to have stopped actively bleeding already. 

Cass shuddered. At least the tingling seemed to have gone away. What now?

Cass re-entered the living room, determined to make it to the bedroom this time. Though her legs were now more sturdy, she still hesitated just before the threshold for a few moments, trying to prepare for what might be lying inside. <em>On three. One... Two...

Three.</em>

Cass turned the corner and took in as much detail as she could before reacting. Sprawled on the bed was the silhouette of a man, limbs askew and legs dangling off the end onto the floor, formed entirely of a fine white ash unlike the grey flakes from the other room. In the figure’s left hand (from Cass’s perspective), a torn scrap of black fabric lay crumpled on the bed, as if the figure was grasping it. Lying near the figure’s right shoulder (from Cass’s perspective) was a small pile of thin glass syringes. Some were broken and a light red stain on the sheets indicated the color of the substance that may have been inside. Small droplets of blood dotted the sheets, floor, and walls. The bedroom window was missing. 

Cass swayed and stepped into the room. <em>Ben? It can’t be; humans don’t burn to ash like that. He’s got to be somewhere else, right?</em> She quietly made her way to the bathroom around the edges of the room, trying to stay as far from the ashen man as possible. As she rounded the bed, she noticed her phone, wallet, and keys scattered on the floor near the window as if someone had thrown them there. She made a quick diversion to pick them up, noting that nothing was missing. Finally, she pushed open the door to the bathroom. Empty. No blood, no ash, no Ben. Cass took some bandages from the medicine cabinet and started covering her wounds as something to keep her hands busy as she thought through the implications of everything she had found. What happened here?

Cass gingerly stepped closer to the ashen figure with a few plastic bags from the bathroom cabinet. The scrap of fabric and a few unbroken syringes were no problem to pick up, but the ash was so fine and so frictionless it was difficult to get any into the bag. Eventually, she managed to sweep a small portion in, noting the consistency was actually more like salt than ash. Very fine, smooth salt. Disturbing, but doable. 

Afterwards, Cass stood up and remembered she had her phone now. Quickly, she pulled it out of her pocket and dialed Ben, holding her breath as it rang, hoping to hear it somewhere in the apartment. Finally, his voice came on the line. “Hi there! You’ve reached Ben, investigative journalist at-” Cass didn’t let the answering machine finish, jabbing the end call button in disappointment. He’d call her back anyway, even without a message. 

<em>Well. Nothing left for me here. Should probably get checked out before I go home, though,</em> Cass thought, idly rubbing the bandages on her neck. <em>Also should be careful with the police. I don&#39;t exactly have a strong abili here. But Christ, what happened to Ben?</em> 

...

Two uncomfortable hours later, Cass stepped into her apartment and collapsed onto the couch. Her mind whirled with thoughts of Ben, the burned apartment, and the starry sea. The clinic had been quite suspicious of her wounds, especially the bite marks around her neck. She had tried to pass it off as a pet dog that had gotten too excited, but she wasn’t sure they had bought it. Still, none of the wounds had required stitches, though they had requested a blood test when she mentioned feeling so nauseous and dizzy. They said they had found some highly unusual compounds and had sent the sample to a more sophisticated lab. Presumably, she’d get her results in a few days. Since she wasn’t feeling too bad afterwards, they let her leave after extracting a promise to come back if she started getting nauseous again.

Cass made herself a light lunch and sat down to eat it without thinking about anything in particular. The internet was a good distraction and she managed to spend about an hour leisurely eating and browsing the web. After that, however, it was time to get to work. Cass promised herself she’d take the evening off as well, then set out her laptop and the bags of evidence she had collected and started asking some questions. 

The salt was the obvious choice to start with. It was so unusual in both physical attributes and in the circumstances surrounding its discovery. After some careful research, however, it looked like there wasn’t much data on the subject online. All Cass had found was a fleeting footnote in an academic paper from 85 years ago mentioning “abnormally frictionless salt” as a byproduct of a procedure involving preservation of mice through “standard preparation procedures followed by encasing the mice in a mold of a novel resin developed by this project.” It noted the resin would sometimes fail to cure and would instead dissolve into the salt if improperly heated, though it notably failed to mention the composition of the resin.

While this footnote seemed potentially related to her search, Cass found to her dismay that not only were all of the authors of the study long dead, but the sponsoring university itself had been shut down just three years later for some sort of legal scandal followed by bankruptcy. Doing the math, there would be no one alive today with a direct relation to the study, and anyone indirectly related would be near-impossible to track down.

                            <span class="markdown">Without further online resources, Cass turned to direct experimentation. The salt was not water-soluble and was quite buoyant; even in small quantities at high heats, it refused to dissolve and just floated along the top of the container. She even tried melting a few grains in a small pan, but even the highest temperatures on her stove could not melt it. A very careful exploration with tweezers and a sharp knife revealed that each individual grain was quite sturdy, unable to be broken apart by Cass’s strength alone. 

Finally, she turned away from the salt to a potentially simpler target. The fabric scrap was very high quality and quite heavy, so after only a few additional minutes of searching, Cass narrowed down a handful of stores that might have some connection with the fabric, or at least be able to tell her where it came from. 

By the time Cass got to the syringes, she was running out of steam. She wrote down the number for a professor of chemistry she had vaguely heard of at the nearest university, Midwest Technological University, and called it a day. Dinner, a long shower, and an early bedtime. Cass hesitated just as she was about to climb into bed. She was exhausted, but sleep had not been kind to her last time. How should she handle this?

Cass slept deeply and dreamlessly, awakening well past 9AM the next morning. Refreshed, she checked her phone. Ben had not called back. She hadn’t expected him to, really, but it still soured her mood somewhat. In the bathroom mirror, she checked her various injuries. The thin cut along her waist was nearly healed, the bite wounds around her neck looked better, and even the two puncture wounds didn’t hurt or feel too hot. 

While eating breakfast, Cass checked the news. The top story for the day seemed to be “Arson attacks continue, leaving two dead.” Quickly skimming the article, Cass noted that Ben was not listed as a victim, though one historian and one librarian had perished at the city’s archives during an attack on the university’s library. Several artifacts had been destroyed, though the specifics weren’t listed. Two other headlines that caught her eye were “Flood warnings increase as rainy weather continues” and “Ground broken on latest addition to subway system.”

The date is Sunday June 6th. The weather is cloudy and cool. How should Cass spend her day?

Cass spent the day researching and writing the six or so stories she had been assigned for the week. Striving to keep the mystery from her mind, she dove into her work with determination. The finished articles kept piling up and by the end of the day, two had been completed, three were in the draft stage waiting on responses from her contacts, and one was awaiting an interview. As she submitted the two finished copies to the editor, Cass slipped in a request to be assigned to the mystery of the cult. Investigative reporting wasn’t normally her thing, but with Ben... <em>missing</em>, there would be a need for someone to work on the stories he didn’t have a chance to finish. Cass sighed and leaned back, satisfied and steadfastly ignoring the pit in her stomach that arose when she had thought about Ben. Why couldn’t more days be this productive? 

It was a little after 7 PM on June 6th. The city was growing dark as the clouds worsened. The forecast predicted heavy rain tomorrow throughout most of the day. There were already new flood watches in effect. Cass gazed out her window at the moon, its shine hardly visible behind a thin layer of clouds. She felt vaguely guilty for not working on the mystery today, but she did have to get work done sometime, and Sunday was probably the best day as many of her contacts would be relaxing.

Cass slept well and the next morning, Monday June 7th, she called the chemistry department at MTU. A brief conversation with the coordinator won her a transfer to Dr Biers, and a description of the salt, its unique properties, and the mysterious paper written by long-dead researchers were enough to convince him to agree to take a look if she brought it over to his lab. Cass additionally mentioned the syringes, coming up with a quick lie about where she got them (she said she had taken them from her deadbeat cousin and wanted to know if they were using illegal or otherwise harmful drugs), and he agreed to look into those as well if the salt was interesting enough. 

Cass wasted little time in heading over to the University. It was a good ten miles away and the parking would be horrible, so Cass hopped on a train running the city’s relatively new Eleloop service. A portmanteau of “elevated” and “loop,” the tracks were built nearly 50 feet in the air in some places, allowing the trains to run overtop of existing roads with few problems. Cass stared out the window as the train rattled along the tracks, the relatively short distance between stops making maglev technology prohibitively expensive for too little gain. The rain was bad, hundreds of fat droplets striking the windows, the roof, and the tracks. From her elevated vantage point, Cass could already see large puddles forming on roads and sidewalks with not enough drainage. Cars splashed up massive fans of water on the roads below. She checked her phone and the NWS confirmed it; the flood watch had been upgraded to a flood warning. “Major” flooding was expected throughout much of the east of the city, near the harbor, while “minor” flooding was expected throughout the rest.

                            <span class="markdown"><em>Ding. “Midwest Tech Campus - Academic,”</em> the train announced as it slowed to a stop. Cass stood, pulled up her hood, and reluctantly left the train, almost staggering due to the force of the rain. <em>Maybe I should have waited a bit</em>, Cass grumbled to herself, sloshing down the platform’s stairs in the midst of a miniature waterfall. She liked the rain, for the most part, but this was just excessive. 

As she walked along the sidewalks towards the Chemistry &amp; Chemical Engineering Complex, shortened to either the CCE or the triple C by students, she passed by a narrow alleyway between two college buildings she didn’t know the names of. A drainage grate a few feet into the alley was clogged with plant matter. Something gurgled underneath the growing puddle and Cass slowed slightly to listen more carefully. <em>“Help... help me...”</em> Something was quietly crying out, partially masked by the water around the drainage grate. Cass paused, concerned. What should she do?

Cass glanced around and picked up a waterlogged stick from a nearby puddle, then slipped into the alley and advanced towards the drainage grate. Slowly and carefully, she pushed the stick into the mass of wet grass and plant matter, moving it aside. The flood of water into the drain increased as she did so and the gurgling grew louder. <em>“Help me, miss. There’s not much time...”</em>

Cass shoved with the stick, trying to get it unstuck from some particularly stubborn clump. She strained against the plants for several seconds before something gave. The stubborn mat of grass snapped and Cass lost her balance, splashing down hard onto the freshly uncovered drainage grate. She let out a sharp gasp both at the pain of the metal bars and at the pair of luminous green eyes staring up at her from the water level in the drain. It was too dark to see what sort of a creature they belonged to, but Cass estimated they were no more than three or so feet down. Probably reachable if she removed that grate. The eyes blinked and Cass felt a short-lived tingling throughout her body. <em>“Help...”</em>

Cass dropped the stick and grasped two of the outermost bars, straining as she slowly lifted the slippery wet grate out of the drain. These kind of grates were only held in place by their own weight, so it was easy - though very strenuous - to remove them. Finally, Cass stepped back and dragged the grate out of the way. Several clumps of plant matter splashed into the drain and the creature burbled. <em>“Help...”</em>

Cass scooped up the stick and, clutching it in fingers still trembling from exertion, thrust it down into the drain. Feeling somewhat self-conscious talking to two eyes in a storm drain, she softly called out, “Grab the stick and climb up!”

Something tugged on the stick and Cass grasped it with her other hand to steady it, suddenly aware of how perilous her position was while dangling halfway into the drain. She couldn’t back out now, though, so she dug in and braced as the thing started to climb the stick. Slowly, as it inched into the dim light, Cass was able to see its body. It was semi-transparent and hazy, the outer limits of its shape difficult to pick out. It was about the size of a kitten with the two huge luminous green eyes she had seen previously. It seemed to have four limbs, but it was hard to tell due to the peculiarities of its form. 

Cass slowly pulled the stick up and out of the drain with the hazy creature still clinging on. She set it on the ground and leaned back, breathing heavily from the exertion. The thing flopped off the stick, then picked itself up and stumbled just off to her side, rubbing against her leg like a cat. Cass followed it with her eyes, confused and very curious.

I give you this gift.”</em> Cass turned to the thing and opened her mouth, intending to ask a question, when she felt a twin pain and choked out a gasp instead. The creature had bitten her leg, midway up her thigh, for a minor but sharp pain. The other pain, a searing hot sensation emanating from the old puncture wounds just below her neck, was much more severe. Cass squeezed her eyes shut against the mounting agony and collapsed heavily onto the water-covered ground. Her ears rang and her sight started to fade. She could see the creature moving slowly and unsteadily along the ground towards her upper chest, neck, or head. What should Cass do, if anything, before she passes out?

Cass let her arms fall to the ground as she weakly waited for unconsciousness to take her. The creature marched up to her neck, crawled inside her jacket, and curled up against her rain-wetted skin. It felt warm and soft against her neck, though it did nothing to dull the terrible pain. Finally, she passed out.

...

Cass came to lying on a series of wooden planks. Slowly, she sat up and surveyed the situation. She was back in the setting from her previous dream, with the aurora shining above and the glassy clear sea lapping at the ground beneath her. The cityscape glowed in the distance. She was sitting on a wooden dock extending from a small island - perhaps 30 feet across - formed primarily of golden-white sand. Light poured from her neck, illuminating the water ahead of her. Several of the round green fish from before fluttered in the water, darting here and there. Cass quickly stood and retreated towards the center of the island, just in case they could jump.

In doing so, she noticed a square stone outline in the sand, located in the approximate center of the island. Approaching, she could see the first few stairs in a flight, the rest buried under sand that glittered and glowed in her light. Waves lapped quietly at the shore. What should Cass do?

<img class="emoji " alt="🐟" title="🐟" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f41f.png" /> - Study the round green fish. [This will cost 1 action.]
<img class="emoji " alt="🌆" title="🌆" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f306.png" /> - Look at the cityscape. It seems so familiar... [This will cost 1 action.]

Cass paused a moment and took the time to really examine the cityscape in the distance. She traced the buildings, compared with the ones she knew, and... Yes! There was no mistaking it. The skyline was identical to that of New Brighton, her city in the waking world. Looking even closer, she noticed shimmering reflections broken by waves located in the city itself. It was flooded. There were no lights near ground level; only the skyline was illuminated. Curious.

Next, Cass carefully made her way back over to the dock, warily eying the green fish still darting around the supports. The dock was old - sagging, but not dangerously so. There were no symbols or other details of note above the water, so Cass dared to head around the side and peek under the dock. Her light illuminated the space and she could spot a series of moss-like growths hanging from the underside of the planks and trailing in the water. Additionally, and more pertinent to her current goals, she spotted a shovel half-buried in the sand, its handle worn smooth by years of use. Quickly, Cass snatched the tool and backed away as one of the fish got too close for comfort.

                            <span class="markdown">Finally, she got to work. The shovel greatly expedited the process of excavation and before she knew it, she was through. The remaining sand hovered above the stairs, defying gravity as if it were made of solid rock. Cass didn’t dare touch it as she brushed past it, holding her breath until she made it past the layer of sand into a more natural-looking smooth stone cavern. Several purple candles were arranged around the cave, providing dim light. Passages stretched to the left and right. To the left, the cloyingly sweet scent of rose petals drifted on a slight haze of dim pink-purple light. To the right, the faint scent of old paper emanated, along with a low yellow illumination. A vague sense of ancient menace permeated both corridors.

Cass picked up a candle without really knowing why - perhaps for illumination, perhaps for study - then quietly entered the corridor to the right. As she walked, she tried to quiet her breathing and slow her footsteps as the calm lapping of the waves above dimmed until the only sounds she could her were her own. Occasional candles provided the yellow light she had noticed earlier. Distantly, Cass thought she could hear rushing water. Her vision blurred and she heard the sound of pounding rain and someone saying words. She felt chilled, soaked through, and temporarily lost track of her dream body. A face swam in her vision but she couldn’t focus and the sensations faded away after a few more seconds. Something told her time was running short.

The corridor narrowed, then abruptly turned a corner. The tunnel broadened into a large warehouse-style room. Rows of shelves piled high with books criss-crossed the space with no apparent pattern, turning the room from an organized storage location into a labyrinth. Just ahead of Cass, in a sort of foyer area for the room, a signpost stood tall above the shelves. Dozens of signs flared off of it, pointing in every direction to dozens of passageways in the stacks, but most were illegible or written in a language Cass couldn’t understand. The few she could read stated the directions to “Fauna,” “Materia,” “Locis,” “Vectura,” and “Arcanus.”

Cass hesitated in the foyer, torn between several possibilities. Finally, she chose an option and quietly tip-toed off into the stacks, following the sign for Materia. The bookshelves overshadowed the path, leaning threateningly overhead and occasionally almost touching. Cass was glad for the candle she had brought, as it allowed her to read the signs posted at every intersection and continue towards the destination she had selected.

Suddenly, after passing another intersection, the bookshelves changed. They were more red now, made of a richer wood than the shelves near the entrance. The signs continued to point forwards, so Cass continued on, even more wary than before. The sounds she had heard earlier resumed, closer than before and now dead ahead. Timidly, she peeked around the next corner and spotted the source of the noises.

Shuffling through the aisle away from her was a stooped figure cloaked in scraps of torn fabric, all drifting slowly as it moved. Every few steps it would reach up with wizened hands and pick up, put back, or slightly move one of the many books on the shelves. Now that she was closer, Cass could hear strained breathing emanating from the figure’s mouth.

There were several nearby passages that looked like they might take her around the figure and rejoin the main route, but they weren’t labeled with signposts. She’d have to be very careful. Alternatively, Cass dreaded to consider, she could approach the figure or move past it. Or she could just leave. Although, now that she was considering it, Cass noticed there weren’t any signs pointing the way back to the entrance...

Cass swallowed hard and gingerly stepped out into the passageway. Something cold and wet splashed her face and she blinked, momentarily back in the alleyway again in New Brighton, with several concerned faces hovering over her. Then she was gone again, back in the passageway with the cloaked figure. She carefully approached and squeaked out a question - something about the salt. She could barely hear her own voice. 

The figure stopped and replaced the book it was holding, then turned towards her. Cass involuntarily stepped back a pace at the sight of the figure’s bandaged face behind the hood, but held her ground beyond that. One of its arms snaked around behind its back to grasp a particular book from a shelf several feet back, then rotated back around to hand it to Cass. The figure breathed a strained hiss of air out of its covered mouth, and the intonation was echoed by dozens of other voices from around the archives. 

<em>“We are sorry for your loss, child.”</em>

Any spell that imbues or evokes a semblance of life, or vitae, requires the use of essentia salts created from a living creature. Any spell that imbues or evokes a semblance of thought, or cogitatio, requires the use of essentia salts created from a living sapient creature. In any case, utilizing the salts in this way - to imbue or evoke their essences in the casting of a spell - will exhaust their properties and they will crumble to inert dust after the spell’s completion.</em>

Cass felt her stomach drop.

Cass stumbled and knelt as she felt her dream-body growing hazy and weak. She quickly returned her eyes to the book and continued reading as the scene dissolved around her. 

<em>One of the most important rituals for any magician, sorcerer, invoker, or other apprentice of magic to know is how to prepare and store essentia salts. To start with the easier task, preparing salt from inanimate objects is significantly more straightforward than animates. One must follow the steps below: 
Place the object to be converted into a bowl or similar device.
Wet the rim of the bowl and outermost edges of the object with pure water, then with a dilute saline solution, then with oil pressed from olives.
Gently sprinkle the object with rock salt, then with potash of sulfur. Take care to avoid excess.
Prepare a solution of concentrated aqua fortis and incant the following lines: 
“in fines tuos elementa
materiae resolvi
y’ah no-sol’ol’ahn ieh
UAEE”
Upon utterance of the final syllable, hold the sound and pour in the acid. Continue to hold the sound until the substance has dissolved into its essentia. In the event the substance has not dissolved, repeat the incantation and add more aqua fortis. Repeat this process up to seven times until substance has dissolved.
Storage of the salts is similarly straightforward. One must simply ensure the vessels are airtight and stored in a cool location away from light. Excess light and heat can cause spontaneous evocation of some properties, potentially leading to a catastrophic chain reaction.</em>

Cass set the book down and closed her eyes as the library went dark, her vision fleeing. She focused on the formula the book had laid out, trying to carefully remember every line. Water, salt water, oil, then... salt and... sulfur potatoes? And the invocation was just as complicated. Still, she did her best.

Two people stood above her and one knelt, looking concerned. They all appeared to be college students, a little younger than Cass but not by much. As her eyes opened, the kneeling person - a young woman with curly brown hair partially hidden by a hood - gasped. “Hey, she’s waking up!” Then, to Cass, “Are you okay? What happened?”

Cass paused a moment to gather her thoughts. She still felt a dual warmth near her neck, one emanating from the wounds and the other from a soft lump curled just below the hollow of her throat. What should she say?

Cass pushed herself into a sitting position, wiping rainwater off her face and feeling the warm lump shift and descend into her jacket. “I’m fine. Just got a little dizzy. I think I need to eat lunch.” She smiled nervously, keenly aware of the skeptical reactions from the three students.

“What about the grate?” one of the other two asked, a tall young man with rain-speckled glasses.

Cass swallowed. “Uh, open when I got here. I was curious; that’s why I came over here.” She shifted uncomfortably, trying to shove the little creature in her jacket into a less conspicuous location. Cass noticed the third person, a smaller fellow with a sparse and not at all flattering mustache, glancing at her torso out of the corner of her eye. Either he was ogling her through her jacket (unlikely, she thought) or he had noticed something.

“Well, I should get going,” Cass said, standing with some difficulty and doing her best to discreetly cup the bottom of her jacket to prevent the creature from falling out. “Thanks for your concern!” she added, walking quickly out of the alley and back into the main campus. 

The creature was wiggling inside Cass’s jacket and seemed to be attempting to pull up her shirt to climb under it as well. It had claws and Cass winced in discomfort as she continued walking as fast as she could reasonably get away with towards her destination. Which is... uh...

Cass continued on towards the CCE, feeling the creature crawl under her shirt, up her side, and come to rest somewhere around her shoulder under two layers of clothing. It seemed satisfied with its location now and finally settled down, curling up and resting against her neck. Cass caught a glimpse of herself in a nearby window. She looked bedraggled and soaked from her adventures in the storm drain, but with her jacket on, she could hardly notice the creature in its current location. Good enough for now, she hoped.

The CCE building was old, brick, and warm, and Cass felt uneasy about how long she’d have to keep her jacket on with the creature in it. And would it even behave for long enough to meet with the doctor? How long would this take, anyway? The elevator arrived and Cass stepped in, cursing silently as someone else got in as well. The doors closed and they were on their way, Cass to the seventh floor and the other person, a nervous looking man in a blue lab coat, to the ninth.

As the doors opened, Cass glanced down the hall and felt a pang of unease. The building was long and straight, so the hallway continued quite a distance. One of the lights was flickering and the buzz of fluorescent tubes was the only sound besides the clattering of the elevator. Cass shook her head and started walking, still a little nervous. Shouldn’t there be more noise up here? It was an active laboratory, right? Cass stopped in the middle of the hallway, glancing back towards the elevator. Her destination was only a few doors ahead, maybe 2/3 of the way from the elevator in the center of the building to the stairwell at the far end. It was so damn quiet.

<img class="emoji " alt="🚶" title="🚶" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f6b6.png" /> - Continue onwards; ignore the silly misgivings.
<img class="emoji " alt="😨" title="😨" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f628.png" /> - Turn back, call the elevator again.
<img class="emoji " alt="👞" title="👞" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f45e.png" /> - Continue, but quietly. Carefully.
<img class="emoji " alt="⬇" title="⬇" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/2b07.png" /> - Go all the way to the other side of the building; take the stairs there.

Cass crept forward, making her way towards the sign marked as 712, the lab where she had been told to meet Dr Biers. The door hung ajar by one of its hinges and Cass quietly peeked into the room. A man in a white lab coat stood hunched over a lab table on the far side of the room, facing away from the door. The room was brightly lit but very hazy, and a fine glittering purple powder layered the floor. A bulbous and pulsating sack-like growth hung from the ceiling by six ropy tendrils near the center of the room, connected by finer strands to the man in the coat. Cass felt her neck start to grow hot as she started to grow lightheaded. Every blink seemed to change the opacity of the sack, the tendrils, the powder. She shifted her grip on the wall slightly to get a better look and a slight scraping sound rose from the door.

The man in the coat spun around to face her and Cass could hardly make out his face under a thick coating of fog or haze. His voice echoed through the empty hall. “Good afternoon, Cass. Dr Biers, pleased to meet you. Are you ready to analyze those samples you promised me?” Cass blinked involuntarily as her neck spasmed and when she opened her eyes again the room was normal. No tendrils, no sack, no haze. Dr Biers stood on the far side of the room, hand outstretched and smiling. Her head hurt.

Cass cleared her throat. “The, uh, samples are pretty heavy. I got them in the building but could you come give me a hand getting them up here?” She felt her own voice rise in fear towards the end and winced. Biers moved forward slightly, holding up his hands placatingly as she stepped back into the hallway somewhat. 

“Hey, no need to get worried. Where are they?”

Cass swallowed and gestured down the hall towards the elevator. “Just over there. Someone helped me get them into the elevator but they were going to a different floor.” Her voice shook and she clenched her fists as her head throbbed and the haze partially reappeared.

“Well that’s no problem,” Biers said. “Let’s go get them.” He walked towards the door and Cass stepped to the side, readying herself to leap. “I’m quite excited to get to studying these. From what you described, the chemicals should be unique.”

The next few seconds were a blur. The doctor exited the room and Cass jumped forwards, grabbing the door and slamming it shut. Biers’ arms shot out to grab her and Cass felt a sharp dragging sensation across her back. The door crashed closed and Biers collapsed to the floor, instantly unconscious. Strands of silken filament and wisps of fog drifted in the air currents. Cass looked up, unsure of exactly how to proceed, when she was tackled by the same man in the blue lab coat from earlier. The two of them fell to the ground in a blur of fists and fabric, the man landing several punches before Cass even had a chance to react. Instinctually, she rolled to the side and kicked the man off, sending him sliding into the wall. Cass scrambled to her feet, clutching her ribs in pain, feeling the creature wiggling around under her shirt. The man on the floor started shoving himself to his feet, reaching into his coat for some sort of item.

Cass grasped the neckline of her shirt and pulled it towards her shoulder, releasing the creature perching there. It jumped off and onto the floor, a blur of half-visible smoke, and darted for the man in the blue coat. Soft dinging noises, akin to the tolling of a small bell, sounded as the creature ran across the floor. Cass hesitated, unsure of exactly what to do, then knelt next to the doctor and shook him. “Hey, you alright? Wake up!” She felt rather ineffectual as she kept an eye on the blue-coated man and the hazy creature.

He had removed the item from his coat, revealing it to be a short metal rod about ten inches in length and perhaps a slim finger’s width in diameter. He raised the rod and pointed it at Cass, then lifted a hand and shouted <em>“Invocarae coruscatio minus! Y’ah! IOUU!”</em> The rod - it could only be described as a wand - crackled with electricity midway through the second word. After the third, the glow dimmed somewhat. The fourth saw the wand concentrate the light towards its tip, and then the creature struck. The man choked as he began the final word as the creature dug into his leg. His hand shifted involuntarily and the wand spat a jagged bolt of power into the ground six inches to Cass’s left. Her hair stood up and a heavy metallic scent arose. The floor sported a noticeable burn mark.

Cass shoved hard against the floor and leapt at the man, sending him crashing into the wall. The wand spun out of his hand and skittered across the floor. Cass let it go, turning her attention towards restraining her assailant, before she realized he was unconscious and bleeding from the back of the head where he had hit the wall. Cass gulped, but busied herself tying his hands together using his own coat. Who knew how long he would be out?

Behind her, Cass heard light dinging noises as the little creature approached. She blinked and its form solidified somewhat, its four short legs becoming visible for a brief moment before dissolving back into hazy semi-transparency. It resembled a small cat, but with more eyes. It stood next to the unconscious man, tail swishing, and stared at Cass. It did not speak, but tapped its paws to produce a gentle chime. Cass stared at it, perplexed, then remembered her situation, snatched up the wand, and turned to Dr Biers.

The doctor was sitting up, rubbing his eyes and looking around disoriented. “What on Earth happened here?” he asked, glancing between Cass, the man, and the creature. “Who are you? What have you done to that man?” Covertly, but not covertly enough to escape Cass’s notice, he slips a hand into his pocket.

Cass made sure to keep the wand low and not pointed at anything but the floor as she answered. “He attacked us; I knocked him out. I’m Cass; do you remember me?”

Dr Biers seemed confused for a moment before his eyes focused. “Ah, right. You called about the samples.” He paused a moment and glanced around. “They’re not normal, are they? You don’t just have a waif following you around for no reason, do you? Something strange is going on here.”

Cass blinked as Biers gestured at the creature, now identified as a waif. He knew more than he had let on. “Y-yeah. It’s a long, weird story that probably shouldn’t be told in a hallway with, uh...” she waved a hand at the blue-coated man and lowered her voice. “Did you know him? Why did he attack us?”

Biers slowly pushed himself off the floor and rubbed his neck. “I don’t know him, but if I had to guess...” He strode over to the man and rifled through his pockets as Cass looked on uncomfortably. The waif rubbed around her ankles, softly chiming. “Yep. Cultist.” He held up a coin-sized piece of metal inscribed with a droplet. “They’re all over the place recently. I’ve had a few stop by before, snooping around and asking questions. This is the first... escalation, though. I wonder if it had something to do with you...” Biers trailed off as he saw Cass’s alarmed expression. “Uh, don’t worry. I can explain. Here, let’s get him and ourselves out of harm’s way. The police can’t be involved with this, as I hope you’ll understand.”

The next fifteen minutes passed quickly as Cass and Biers stuffed the man into a storage closet for temporary safekeeping, then headed off campus to talk. They ended up at a busy cafe, packed into a booth with surroundings loud enough to not be overheard. Biers ordered some kind of seafood; Cass got a chef salad. While they waited for their food, Cass quietly described her involvement with the mystery of the cult. The waif had curled up on the table and was napping quietly by the saltshaker. Biers had explained it wasn’t visible to normal people; only to those who had magic in their system.

After she completed her story, Biers sighed. “I see. I’m sorry that you and poor Ben had to get caught up in all this. But since you’re in the thick of it now, you’re going to need to be careful in order to avoid ending up like I almost was with that void heart - thanks for getting me out of there, by the way. And to be careful, you’ll need some information. So let me tell you what I know.”

He paused briefly to accept the food and then continued after the waiter had left. “There’s a cult operating out of somewhere in New Brighton. I’m not entirely sure what their aims are, or what they’re worshipping, but they’re large and powerful enough to have sympathizers in the city government. We can’t trust the police; your average beat cop might be fine, but once news of a cultist’s arrest has been passed up the ranks, they’ll walk free in a matter of hours. They’ve got a significant informant network, meaning people like me, you, and Ben who investigate too deeply will be either quietly or not so quietly disappeared. I’ve been relatively safe up until today due to the college’s protection, but they must have finally gotten someone on the inside and took a shot. I don’t know if it was connected to your arrival or not, but I have to think it was. They wouldn’t plant a void heart without having a good reason.

The solstices and equinoxes have always been powerful times for magic, so I’d bet they’re going to attempt some big ritual then, which would be bad news for us normal people. If you’re looking for some sort of deadline to solve the mystery, that date would be the one I’d pick.

“Unfortunately, I don’t otherwise have much in the way of information about the cult. They’ve managed to keep themselves fairly hidden, but of course I haven’t done much in the way of investigating either. I’ve been mostly working on designing rituals to have a chance of fighting back. You, however, seem like you’ve already uncovered a few leads to trace. I’m not much for fieldwork, but if you need anything from me, you just let me know.

“So what’s your background with this? Why do you know so much about magic?”

Biers sighed. “It’s a fair question, but it’s never a fun story to tell. To be brief, my father was a magician of sorts, wielding powers beyond this world through a book his father had passed down to him, and his father before him. He would perform rituals and cast spells to improve our fortunes, quietly sabotage his enemies, and in one memorable incident, even banish someone he wasn’t fond of to the moon. The howling they made as they rocketed upwards... Anyway, his deeds eventually caught up with him and he was taken in the night by some sort of shadow, a guardian of one of the ancient places he was fond of raiding. I inherited the book and started to learn spells of my own, at first for no reason besides curiosity, but later to dig into the fundamental lore of this world.” Biers smiled dryly. “So I suppose still out of curiosity, but a more scientific one.”

Cass stayed silent for a moment and idly picked at her food. “So what have you found out? How does magic work, exactly?”

“The full study of magic takes perhaps years, but in your case you don’t need all the subtleties. In short, magic involves performing certain rituals using particular gestures, sounds, materials, and so on to appeal to various higher powers. One might call them gods, but I don’t want to step on the toes of any religions. Suffice to say, most of these beings will respond well to particular offerings or rituals that have been documented over the ages, and respond poorly to others. That’s the gist of it; these beings can bend or break the standard laws of reality, and for some reason or another their power can be channeled by people like us as long as we perform the right rituals. If you’re looking to understand <em>why</em> exactly it works like this, I’m afraid I can’t help you.”

“Ah, yes. This waif, along with many other creatures, isn’t one of the godlike beings I mentioned earlier. It’s a lesser creature, bound to magic in such a way that it goes mostly unnoticed except by those who have magic in their system, as you and I do. Waifs in particular are formed of fragments of lingering wills. They’re collections of souls or soul fragments that didn’t pass on, but didn’t have the power to maintain their form. Over time, this sort of... slurry collects and forms into little creatures like this. They’re generally either affectionate or feral. You seem to have gotten lucky with yours; I think it’s bonded.” 

Cass half-smiled at the waif, her mind miles away. She found herself idly petting it. What now?

“I had... a dream... several dreams, actually, about drifting on a clear ocean with stars and nebulae above and below the water. There was a city in the distance. It... looked like this one. At one point I was on an island and there were stairs, and at the bottom there was a massive library with bandaged... people? creatures? wandering around. They gave me a book about magic. Do you think any of that is important?”

Biers smiled. “From your description, you’ve had a few trips to the surface of the realm of dreams, known to some as Ailoe, to others as Kadath, and to still others as Lunaris. When you travel there, you aren’t just dreaming; you are to some extent traveling there in spirit and in person. You can find many tidbits of knowledge in the collective eons of dreams of every conscious being, but just as many nightmares. The deeper you go into that place, the greater the rewards, the greater the danger, and the harder it is to get out. One man, I’ve heard, was stuck in there for upwards of a decade, and was nearly unrecognizable when he finally escaped. If you do plan on going back there, be very careful. Accessing the dreamlands is a common ability amongst students of magic, so I wouldn’t be surprised if our cultist friends might meet you there. I’m going to repeat this, since it’s extremely important. <em>Be careful in the dreamlands.</em> You aren’t invincible, and you can die in there. Your waif can accompany you there, and it will help you, but it’s not foolproof. You’re not foolproof. I’m not foolproof. The deeper reaches of the dreamlands, accessible through the Gates of Deeper Slumber, are deadly wilderness.”

Biers cleared his throat and took a sip of water. “Sorry for being so dramatic, but I don’t want you to go in there feeling overconfident. It may even be better to stay away from them entirely.”

Cass stayed silent for a while. “In the real world, then, what was that tendril-thing in the lab? You called it a void heart, I think?”

                            <span class="markdown">Biers grimaced. “Yes, that. Void hearts are a certain type of plant native to the dreamlands. They can be moved by enterprising cultists - apparently - and replanted even in the waking world. As you may have seen, they are capable of disguising themselves quite well to those without truer sight such as yourself, and they can puppet individuals using their tendrils to lure in more prey. They aren’t sentient, really, but they can use parts of their hosts’ memories to understand how they’re supposed to behave and be more convincing. I will have to deal with that one at some point, since it is rather in the way. They can be quite deadly given enough time to digest their hosts’ memories enough. Eventual death comes by paralysis and liquefaction. Not a pleasant end.”

Cass drummed her fingers on the table quietly, thinking.

“So, anything else you’d like to know? If not, what’s the plan?”

Cass accompanied Dr Biers back to campus where he wasted no time in gathering the materials to fumigate the lab currently occupied by the void heart. As he explained, the plant would draw in the toxins in the gas he pumped in over a few hours, hopefully killing it before anyone else noticed or tried to enter the lab. The blue-coated man in the closet was more of a concern, however. He was now awake and angry, shoving against his bonds and shouting in a muffled manner through the tape over his mouth. 

Cass wasn’t entirely sure what to do with him, and Dr Biers wasn’t either. As he had stated previously, getting the police involved may do more harm than good, and releasing this cultist back to his brethren seemed the height of folly. Biers closed the door again while the two of them thought on a way to dispose of the man on a more permanent basis. After dealing with him in some fashion and letting the lab air out, then cleaning up the remains of the void heart, Biers estimated it would take a few hours to determine the contents of the syringes. Cass would have some time on her own to explore, study, practice, or accomplish some other goal while she waited for the results. She just had to decide what to do first.

Biers seemed reluctant when Cass brought up the idea of turning the man into salt, but he eventually agreed it would be the most straightforward way to remove the evidence. He offered to perform the ritual himself but Cass declined, wanting to understand and utilize magic herself. Additionally, she quietly felt a sense of responsibility for this man’s imminent death and felt like it would be more respectful to perform the spell herself.

The ritual itself wasn’t difficult, and was in fact shockingly simple. The materials she had to use - a large container, water, saltwater, olive oil, table salt, potassium sulfate, and nitric acid - were easily available from labs in the building. The incantation was complicated but perfectly pronounceable with practice and a reference. The only change from the procedure she had read in her dream was to add a single droplet of her own blood to the mixture (“sap of the invoker’s veins,” as the book called it) and include one additional line in the invocation. In the old days, Biers explained, ritualists had used knives or other devices, but in modern times a hypodermic needle could work just as well and could preserve the sample for any future spells if needed.

The spell worked quickly, though not as quickly as Cass would have hoped. Immediately after the first invocation and the first sprinkle of nitric acid, the cultist screamed long and loud into the gag as his extremities and the location the acid splashed began to melt, condensing and dissolving into grains of salt. Cass ran out of breath and paused a moment before beginning to repeat the invocation, watching the man in horror. He was panting and crying, his limbs bleeding heavily and his torso half-collapsed under its own weight. 

Cass choked, almost unable to continue, before Biers spoke up. “At this point we’re committed to the ritual. Please, put him out of his misery.”

                            <span class="markdown">It took three additional repetitions of the invocations to get the man to stop screaming, and two beyond that to fully dissolve his mass.

As soon as the ritual was complete, Cass excused herself to go somewhere - anywhere that wasn’t here - to compose herself. She found herself in a silent, unused conference room, hugging herself on the chair and listening to the man cry out over and over in her mind. Magic wasn’t what she had expected. Something whispered in the back of her mind, exulting quietly at the power she had wielded. Cass felt sick and pushed the voice away. The waif trotted after her, dinging softly, and she tickled its chin. 

What now? [Careful. As Cass studies the mysteries of magic and the cult, her state of mind may change or degrade. You can keep an eye on it in her Inventory page. If she delves too deep, strange things may start to happen...]

Cass spent the better part of an hour in the dark conference room, watching the rain outside pound against the building, though it was slowly beginning to ease off. The waif had curled up in her lap and apparently gone to sleep. Cass found herself absentmindedly petting it. It was soft and warm and purred quietly in its sleep. She wondered briefly if Biers wasn’t just pulling some sort of trick and she had just rescued a kitten from a storm drain, but the waif’s mostly-transparent legs refused to lend support to that idea.

...fuck, she had killed a man. Personally, directly, and in one of the most agonizingly painful ways she could imagine. Cass couldn’t shake the sounds he had made out of her head, the raw-throated screaming muffled by the gag as the man had dissolved into a pile of bloody salt. And Biers had seemed so unfazed by the whole thing. Doubts whispered at the edge of her mind. Was Biers actually who he said he was? What motivation did he have to help her, besides the fact that she... had saved his life. Ah.

...or had she? Cass carried on with her worrying train of thought, unable to muster the willpower to wrench herself away. The man had never attacked Biers; only Cass. What if the doctor was playing a longer game? What had the plant actually done to him? All she had to go on were his own words and assurances!

Cass squeezed her eyes shut and hugged the waif tightly, interrupting its purr with the sudden change in position. She couldn’t shake off the anxiety and it settled uncomfortably into a tense ball in her stomach. Why the hell had he let her kill the man? Why had <em>she</em> let herself kill the man? She only had Biers’ word that the police weren’t to be trusted; the man had clearly committed assault and could have easily been arrested! Even if Biers was telling the truth, maybe it would have been better to let the cultist escape just to avoid his terrible fate.

Her phone vibrated in her pocket and Cass quickly disentangled herself from the waif. Biers was calling.

The call was brief and Cass did her best to remain as neutral as possible throughout. Biers had finished working through the samples and was ready to deliver his verdict. Cass told him she’d be there shortly, then set the waif back down onto the floor and gazed out the windows. The edge of the storm was visible, the golden light of the approaching sunset shining through the patchy clouds over the city’s harbor. The rain was thinning and Cass allowed herself to hope the ride back home would be much more tolerable than the one to campus.

As she entered the lab on the opposite side of the hall from the one currently containing the void heart, Biers raised a hand in greeting. “Hello again. I’ve got some very interesting news, I think you’ll agree. Shall we start with the salt or the syringes?”

Cass paused a moment. “Salt.”

“Now you might find this hard to believe, and I did too.” Biers gestured to a printout of a graph that meant absolutely nothing to Cass. “As you can see here, here, and there, this salt is inert. As you mentioned you found it in the aftermath of the... incident at your friend’s apartment, that means one of two things. First, it could mean what you undoubtedly already suspect: that they dissolved him into salt and then raised his shade, releasing the salt’s energy. This doesn’t make a lot of sense - why would they need to raise a shade to interrogate when it’s so much less convenient than just interrogating the living person directly? The other option is that this salt is a forgery. Deliberately planted to make you believe that your friend is dead, while in reality something else happened.”

Seeing Cass’s expression, Biers cautioned “Don’t get too excited, however. Even if he’s still alive, he could be in even graver danger than mere death. This only makes it more important to determine what happened.”

                            <span class="markdown">He paused for several seconds, then continued with his second discovery. “The syringes, however, are far from inert. They’ve got an odd mix of chemicals in them that I haven’t seen before. A lot of the higher-concentration ones, however, are often used in rituals pertaining to dreams and the controlling thereof. If you have reason to believe you were injected with these, then I would say someone has been trying to either shape your dreams or grant you some ability to control them yourself. I’m not sure to what degree, and I’m not sure to what end, but it’s certainly concerning. I’m going to be honest, I don’t know what they want with you in particular, but it’s becoming unfortunately clear that you specifically are of special interest to the cult, whatever its eventual goals are.”

Biers paused again, seemingly waiting for Cass to speak. Before she had fully sorted out her thoughts, however, he continued. “So, what’s your plan now? I’m at somewhat of a dead end myself.”

It is now later in the afternoon on Monday, June 7th. The rain clouds are clearing up. Golden light from the impending sunset is filtering through the remaining clouds.

Biers wasn’t surprised when Cass said she was going to go home and think about everything the day had thrown at her. He bid her good evening and asked her to call if she needed anything tomorrow or in the days leading up to the solstice.

The walk back to the train station was long and gloomy. Cass moved slowly, burdened by her thoughts, while the waif trotted along and kept pace. There were few people visible in the twilight and Cass paused at the station to wonder where the afternoon had gone. She could have sworn she had just left the doctor around sunset, and it was already trending towards the darkness of night. Her watch told her it was a little after 9PM, which would explain the lack of sun, but it didn’t explain where those hours had gone. Had she really been in that conference room for so long?

A train arrived after only a few minutes of standing on the platform, merrily announcing <em>“This is a Green Line train to Water’s Edge. 9th/Thomas is next. Doors open on the left at 9th/Thomas.”</em> She smiled briefly at the train’s enthusiasm before settling into a seat near the door, exhausted.

<em>Ding dong. “Doors closing.”</em>

Cass opened her eyes a few stops later and stepped off the platform onto the still-damp streets. A somewhat tall man standing on the street corner a block away from her apartment building caused her some mild concern as he glanced in her direction, but he seemed preoccupied smoking and she was just too tired to care. A late dinner, shower, then bed.

Cass frowned at her phone, confused. It wasn’t Wednesday already, was it? Wasn’t yesterday Monday? She looked around, concerned, then got out of bed and walked to the window to look out and see if anything was off. The sun reflected brilliantly off the windows of the building across the street, casting chips of light across the road. Left, right. Nothing seemed off; there were no people around, but that wasn’t terribly unusual for relatively early in the morning.

Cass poked around the apartment, finding nothing out of the ordinary, then headed outside to see if anything could make some sense of the missing day. She was beginning to think she had either forgotten what day it was or somehow slept through the entirety of Tuesday when she discovered a small metal spike driven into the sidewalk slightly off one corner of her building. The waif seemed interested, sniffing around the stake and brushing up against it.

Cass glanced down the street and spotted another spike, driven into the sidewalk on the opposite side of the building. On approaching, she saw the two formed a straight line flush with the sidewalk, and confirming her suspicions, Cass found two more in the alley around the back, forming a perfect square around the building. Concerned, she levered one out of the ground to break the shape. 

The metal grew hot as she removed it from the grid, then red lines flashed between the three remaining spikes and faded. The ground rumbled and the sun went out. Cass gasped as warm, perfectly clear water surged out of nowhere and flooded the street up to her calves. Light burst from her neck as menacing humanoid shadows leered from the dark alleyways surrounding her and slowly advanced. The waif’s fur stood on end and it growled. What should Cass do, and how should she do it?

Cass sloshed back inside, twisting her body back and forth to deter the shadows advancing from both directions. Her light seemed to injure or at least annoy them, with the forms hissing and recoiling when she faced them. Cass shut and locked the front door, then splashed up the stairs through a slow waterfall of glass-clear water to her apartment.

Once shut inside, however, she wasn’t entirely sure what to do from there. She was fairly sure she was dreaming, or at least she hoped mightily that was the case, but emerging from this nightmare wouldn’t be a straightforward task. Cass looked out the window and noticed the shadows still advancing. Some were crawling up the brickwork, while others were wrestling with the door. She wouldn’t have long. What should she do?

The waif trotted up to her leg and rubbed against it softly. Cass tore her gaze from the window and bent down to pet it, wondering how exactly the waif would help her escape this dream. At least she certainly hoped it was a dream. 

The waif pawed and headbutted Cass until she cooperated and sat on her bed, then leaned back at the waif’s prodding until she was prone. The shadows scratched at the windows on the far side of the room as the waif trotted along her body and curled up on her chest, tucking its head under its tail and starting to purr. Cass glanced around uneasily, watching the shadows pick at the window. What was it doing? Was she supposed to do something else?

Cass blinked as something rough scraped invisibly across her face and her limbs suddenly stopped responding. Still, she managed to hold in her panic until the window snapped open and a line of shadows crawled disjointedly into the room. Cass’s heart pounded as she stared, paralyzed. The shadows crawled closer and closer until they were lightly brushing against her body as they moved towards the light at her neck. Something invisible slapped across her head and she felt a momentary shift in the room’s brightness.

The fastest shadow brushed through the waif, not even seeming to notice it, and traced a delicate line across Cass’s skin towards the light. She would have screamed if she could, as her neck throbbed in agony and burned hotter as the shadow advanced.

The waif was sitting on her chest, slapping her around the head with its paws and dinging loudly. Seeing her eyes shoot open, it sounded a different tone and happily jumped down onto the bed. Cass gasped for breath, looking down at her neck and chest. A thin black line extended several inches downwards from the two puncture wounds before fading. It hurt like a burn. She could still feel the shadow’s freezing hot claws on her skin. It is 9 AM on Tuesday June 8th. The day is sunny and warm. What will Cass do?

Cass discovered the following information:

Her bedroom window was open when she woke up. The stakes were real, driven into the ground surrounding her apartment building. Cass quietly pulled them up while no one was looking and brought them back to investigate. They appear to be made of regular steel, though the waif continued to sniff them and would occasionally sneeze. On asking Biers, he admitted he had never heard of something similar to the stakes, though he would guess they allowed some sort of control over dreams. To what end, given the unusual nature of her dream, he couldn’t say.

Digging deeper, Cass found a reference to similar implements in a recent suicide case - a 17 year old boy had either fallen or jumped from his window on the 8th story late at night. Screaming had been reported beforehand, and the screen had been forced open from the outside. Similar stakes were found surrounding the building, though no link had been confirmed between them and the boy’s death.

The particular steel used in the stakes in the boy’s case had been traced back to a particular foundry on the outskirts of New Brighton, though again, no link had been confirmed between it and the boy’s death. Cass looked up the company - Henderson Casting and Metalwork - and found a current website, phone number, and address. She wrote them down for possible future reference.

A night’s rest, dreamless and quiet. It is now Wednesday, June 9th. The day is sunny and hot. Another arson incident has been reported in the papers, this time destroying nearly an entire city block of cramped apartments in the slums and killing dozens. What will Cass do?

Cass spent the day working on her assigned articles for the week, but she could hardly focus. She felt listless and distracted, and the dark line down her chest was itchy and painful. Every so often, she could have sworn she heard a tapping or scratching at the windows, but nothing was ever there. The offensive heat and high humidity didn’t help and she found herself irritated, tired, and sweaty at the end of the day. A little work accomplished, but not enough. The waif spent most of the day sleeping on her couch in the midst of a puddle of sunshine from the window.

That night, Cass dreamt of the starry sea again. She was standing on a smooth, clear crystal pillar rising a few feet out of the calmly lapping water. An indistinct figure in flowing red robes stood beside her, throwing some sort of meat from a bucket into the ocean with the aid of a small shovel. Dozens of the little green fish from earlier thrashed about the surface, all fighting for a single scrap of the prize. 

The figure turned away from the water once the bucket was exhausted and Cass saw her own face, though older and with unfamiliar scars, framed in the robes’ hood. She opened her mouth to say something - though she wasn’t sure exactly what - but other-her put a finger to her lips and winked. “They don’t like noise,” the second Cass whispered. “Gets them all riled up.”

The older Cass moved backwards several steps until she was balancing on the edge of the crystal pillar. “Sometimes you don’t have to be the one to make the sacrifice,” she said, leaning back and starting to fall. “Sometimes others can take your place.” Time seemed to slow as she fell. “Promise me you’ll remember that.”

Cass looked away after the splash. The water ran red. She awakened clutching a tiny cloth doll, about as tall as her fingernail. The doll had Cass’s own features outlined in impossibly fine needlework and wore a flowing red dress.

Cass armed herself with a bottle of water and some sunscreen, then headed out to investigate the mysteriously large fish. The train took her to the beach where it was discovered, where she interviewed several witnesses besides the original woman who reported it to the papers to begin with.

Employees at a nearby beachfront hotel described the sounds the thing had made as it came ashore early in the morning, moaning and howling and thundering as it rolled around on the beach. They described it as at least 30 feet long and bulky enough to go with it. One of them, the porter, had snuck down to take a look before the police had arrived. She explained the thing had tired itself out by the time she got there - it had been slowly and painfully heaving for breath, its sides rising and falling like bellows. It had pale, nearly translucent scales and small purple eyes that seemed to focus on her altogether more than she had liked. The teeth were excessively large and serrated. She had run back to the hotel when she heard cars approaching.

Cass also talked to the officers standing at the entrance to the beach. They let her know an investigation was still in progress, she would not be let in until its conclusion, and they expected the beach to re-open later this afternoon. Visible behind the police, at the water’s edge, the fish lay covered in a tarp. Dozens of people in protective gear and suits hurried around with sprayers, ropes, and spikes. Even from this distance, Cass could tell the fish still breathed.

She could attempt to sneak closer past the police to get a better look - the beach was far too large for only two officers to guard the entire perimeter. She could also loiter around the area for a while, keeping an eye on proceedings from a distance. Or she could pack it in and go do something else with the afternoon. She already had a much more thorough story than the quick hack-piece that had appeared this morning. Though it could always be better...

Cass wasn’t entirely sure how this would work, but she had a theory that the fish and the dream world would be connected. She took some medicine to help her sleep, then hid herself nearby the beach as drowsiness washed over her, trying to keep the fish in her thoughts as much as possible. Minutes later, she was back in the starry sea.

Cass was floating in cold, clear water, far beneath the surface of the ocean. All was dark around her, though her neck shone enough light for her to see a few dozen feet in front of her. She couldn’t breathe, but if she didn’t focus on that thought, it seemed she didn’t need to. A deep bass note sounded from below, and Cass slowly began swimming towards it. An answering note, higher in pitch and more demanding, sounded from above - the ocean vibrated in response. Columns of bubbles rose from below and Cass was swept into a rapidly rising current, blasting towards the surface. She caught a glimpse of a pale object tumbling in the current with her, and she knew the fish she sought was here too. Cass saw the water’s surface approaching and felt the ocean warming. There was an odd silhouette just above them, though...

Cass and the pale fish slammed into a massive net at high speed. Cass screamed - as best she could underwater, at least - as she was catapulted out of the net, streaming blood from dozens of lacerations where the net had caught her. She curled into a ball against the pain and saw the pale fish thrash in the net, its great bleeding bulk too large to escape the same way Cass had. 

Cass felt her head break the surface and she looked up, treading water with one arm and pressing against her wounds with the other. A large fishing yacht floated nearby, slowly reeling in the fish with an enormous winch. Cass pulled herself next to the boat and pressed against it, listening closely. She could hear voices from the deck.

A woman answered. “Fear not, Davis. The seals have been reinforced with ivory bindings, while the physical locks have new clearsteel cores. The only reason for the previous debacle was the interconnection between the seals and locks. Now the systems are separate; there’s no way it could happen again.”

“Look, I don’t pretend to get what you’re talking about, but as long as it stays <em>inside</em> the pen this time, there’s no problem. We’ve got less than 2 weeks to get this thing finished and we can’t afford more delays.”

“Have faith in the expertise of our enchanters, Davis. There will be no further issues. Now, stand back. It’s in position. Are you ready to return?”

“Yeah, no point in hanging around here too much longer.”

“Very well. One moment.” The woman began speaking a long and complicated series of words Cass could barely catch - those she could hear, she recognized as similar to those from the spells she had been studying. The boat began to dimly glow purple, then more brightly. The bloody water near the hull began to take on a dim shine as well - or it could just be a reflection. Cass suddenly wondered if she should still be hanging onto the rigging when the spell was completed.

The water began to swell and boil as the woman approached the end of the spell, then, with a final shout, reality lurched. The boat leapt forward and Cass was thrown from the rigging as it rocked backwards upon arrival. She had only a second to take in the scene - it was nighttime and the docks of New Brighton glowed not far in the distance - before she felt a stretching tug towards the city, quickly escalating to a burning heat. She saw in two places at once for a few brief moments, both jerking awake near the beach and flailing wildly in the lake, before the landscape blurred and she splashed down into the water somewhere much closer to the land. 

Cass could see the beach to one side of her and the boat’s lights to the other, each an approximately equal distance away. She considered paddling after the boat, but it was already moving quickly towards the docks and soon disappeared from view behind the bright lights of the marina. Bewildered, she swam to shore and dried herself off the best she could, noting as she did so that she had again carried over a less severe version of the wounds she had sustained in the dreams.

On the train ride back to her apartment, Cass sat back with eyes closed, trying to recall the final blurred glimpse she had caught of the boat before being ripped away and back to her other body. She had seen the name, she was sure of it. The... Starlight? Starsword? Something with a “star” in it. And a name! “Davis,” the woman had called the man. It wasn’t much; she wasn’t even sure if it was a first or last name. But it was somewhere to start. Plus, she knew they were on a boat and heading for around the marina. Lots of potential leads, of course all assuming these were the cultists she was searching for. Another busy day tomorrow.

... the Starfury! That was it.

G-plus Manufacturing was the name of the company that had been attacked. A manufacturer of wood and metal components, and an assembler of complete furniture products. Not at all what Cass would consider a likely target for a possibly cult-related arson attack. The previous incidents had been mostly knowledge-based, with journalists and archives getting burned. Though the attack in the slums had seemed out of the norm, Cass reasoned it may have been another attack on someone who knew too much, gotten slightly out of hand.

But a furniture manufacturer; why? It made no sense; there was no one to burn there. Cass dove into research on this first. There must be a pattern; a reason. Hours passed with no results besides dozens of trivia facts about woodworking until finally, there it was. A minor footnote in an online encyclopedia: “G-plus Manufacturing is a direct competitor with Henderson Casting and Metalwork, particularly in steel fasteners.”

Cass leaned back. It wasn’t much, but it was a motive, and it was something to tie the attack to the cult. Were they attempting to put G-plus out of business to increase Henderson’s market share? Was it an intimidation tactic? How were the stakes she found related to this? Always more questions.

She took a break to polish up and submit a few of the articles she had left half-completed from a few days ago, then volunteered her services for the special project that had popped up - “Comprehensive report on cult activity.” The publishing deadline for the project was worryingly distant - June 20th. That meant it had to be good, and it had to be thorough. Still, its timing - just before the solstice - meant that publishing something impressive on that day might prove a powerful weapon against the cult.

Cass managed to dig up an artist’s representation of her through some contacts in the police department and she had to admit, the girl looked incredibly familiar. Cass must have seen her before, or at least someone who resembled her. The inability to remember was maddening! Was it at the beach? At the college? Just on the street somewhere? Maybe sleeping on it would prompt her recollection.

In her dreams that night, Cass walked amongst a sea of people, all with the girl’s features. Waking brought no clarity. It is now Saturday, June 12th. The day is cloudy and cool. No outstanding news stories have been reported. What will Cass do?

Cass spent much of the day digging through databases matching names to faces, trying to recall where she had seen the arsonist before. Hours passed without much progress before finally, the waif dinged into the room and jumped up onto her shoulder, nuzzling the side of her head. Cass jumped, startled, as the movement triggered a memory.

When she had first met the waif, back in the alley at the college. After saving it, after she had passed out and woke up. Three students, one of them a girl. Was she the same person? Looking at the artist’s sketch and thinking back to that day, Cass found it likely. The jacket, the hood, the curly brown hair. Now if she could just find a name to go on. Unfortunately, the police sketch didn’t turn anything up in the normal matching databases; she would likely have to get an actual picture, and hopefully one at a convenient angle.

On a whim, however, Cass took all the Davises from the college’s public directory and pulled pictures from the databases from earlier, curious if one of them would match either of the two guys who had been with the girl in the alley. To her surprise, one of them actually came up. Tom Davis, fifth year mechanical engineering student, was the smaller man with the sparse mustache and slightly creepy demeanor. From there, it was easy to check his social media for pictures with the girl and get a name. Emma Newfeld, fourth year chemical engineering student at Midwest Tech, and probable arsonist. Cass leaned back and stretched, grinning despite herself. Now that was a lead.

Cass stared at the note, concerned. Obviously she had to go to the meeting; that wasn’t a question. It wasn’t even that it was obviously a trap. It was the fact that she had proof the cult was spying on her and knew where she lived. She had suspected with the stakes in the ground, but now it was indisputable. So if they knew who she was and where she lived, why was she still alive?

Cass continued to ponder that question as she took precautions in advance of the meeting, setting up a dead man’s email that would send everything she knew about the cult to both her paper and Dr Biers if she didn’t make it back in a reasonable amount of time. She also, though hesitantly and nervously, headed out and started the purchase process on a pistol, small and easily concealable. The clerk seemed lightly suspicious of her reasoning for buying the weapon, and the background check would take several days to clear. It wouldn’t be ready by the meeting time, but at least she’d have it for later.

By this point, it was only around 3 in the afternoon. Cass still had plenty of time to search for connections between the <em>Starfury</em> and Emma. Social media was again her best friend, and Cass was able to find the girl and her friends on an outing on the very same boat. She didn’t appear to be the owner of the craft, though with some photo restoration, a little guessing, and a few questionably legal phone calls, Cass was able to figure out who was.

The boat was registered to Henderson Casting and Metalworks. Now this was some news. Cass had expected the company to be involved in some fashion, but not quite as deeply as she now found it. She was getting close to the root of the mystery here, she knew it. What was the connection here, though? Why a boat; why the fish? Why would this company partner with an otherwise unremarkable chemical engineering student? What was the cult’s end goal here?

Cass crept down the steps, careful to avoid splashing in the eerily still water. A short descent later, the stairs opened out into a wider room. Cass ducked down in the shadows and pressed herself against the wall, hopefully invisible in the near-darkness. The gun felt heavy in her hand. The room was the main concourse of a subway station. Ticket machines and turnstiles lined the entrance, and visible in the half-light of the central section were two familiar people. Cass crept closer as Emma and Tom talked in low voices.

“I’m not seeing anything weird,” Tom said quietly. “It would help a lot if you would tell me what we’re looking for, you know.”

Emma swept a flashlight across the station. Cass quickly maneuvered herself to avoid the beam. “Look, I told you, you’ll know it when you see it. This thing’s existence is on a need to know basis. Just don’t let it sneak up on you.”

Tom paused a moment and glanced nervously down a tunnel. “I feel like hunting this thing constitutes a need to know. Why are we even in this train station? Why would it be here, whatever it is?”

Emma sighed. “I’ve been tracking its signature. It’s here, alright. I don’t know why, but I’m not about to let it get away. We’ve only got seven days left before go time and we need this thing for the ritual.”

Tom seemed like he was about to respond when his jaw dropped and he elbowed Emma. She turned angrily and abruptly, catching Cass squarely in the flashlight as it swept the room. “You!” she shouted, stepping forward before she could finish her turn towards Tom.

A massive white shape burst from the darkness, all hair and teeth, and crashed into Emma and Tom. Both flashlights went out, leaving the room in darkness. Cass felt at her neck, pulling her shirt down to allow the light to pour out, but nothing came. The ground vibrated with the thing’s footsteps and she heard Emma scream. What should Cass do?

The gun kicked in her hands as Cass fired at the creature. The room was illuminated briefly six times as the muzzle flared again and again, emptying all six chambers. The beast roared loudly, then trailed off into a sort of gurgling cough. The ground shook again as its bloated shape collapsed to the floor, trickling deep purple blood.

A moment passed before the light began to shine from Cass’s neck again and she darted forward, hastily reloading the gun from nowhere in particular as she ran. The dream began to dissolve around her as she approached, the walls and ceiling melting into distorted projections of the starry background beyond, but the scene retained enough coherence to still be perfectly legible when she finally arrived at the scene of the fight.

The pale beast had collapsed on top of Emma, pinning her legs and one arm to the ground. The girl lay very still aside from a slight rise and fall of her chest, a trickle of blood spilling from her mouth. Tom was in much worse shape, however. Cass had to look away after only a short glance, tearing her eyes away from first his shattered head, then his bisected torso. She shuddered, squeezing her eyes shut. When she reopened them, the dream had dissolved almost completely. The only sight left was Emma’s unconscious face, bloodied and vacant.

Cass woke up in a cold sweat and bolted out of bed, drawing a protesting mew from the waif as it rolled down the newly-created slope. It yawned and stretched, then presented itself for petting. Cass idly stroked the creature, playing the dream back in her mind. It is now Monday, June 14th. The meeting is scheduled for today at the Celestial Hotel. The day is cooler and cloudy, with a chance of rain. The grisly demise of a male student was reported in the paper, and Cass didn’t have to dig to know it was Tom. She can’t seem to stop shaking, no matter how lightly. What should she do with the day?

Cass knew, or at least suspected, that she would be meeting with Emma tonight at the hotel anyway, but she had to find out what had happened to her. It might not be too difficult to find some sort of contact information for her, or even an address, but Cass dismissed those ideas as being too stalker-like. She found it unlikely Emma would answer her, much less take it in a good way, if she tracked her down like that. In a way, Cass felt sorry for her. She was swept up in such a mess and had recently lost a friend. Cass half-wondered if Emma would even show up to the meeting.

The university might be some help, if Emma had classes today. Back to social media, Cass supposed, with maybe an additional dig through leaked databases to see if there were any class schedules or attendance records available online. Let’s see here... fourth year chemical engineering and if she was taking classes now, there would only be a few options available. Only two professors, each with less than ten students. If she could come up with a convincing reason for them to tell her, Cass was certain they’d be able to remember Emma and would know if she had showed up today. But of course that alone wouldn’t be a confirmation if she hadn’t. Either way, it was a start.

Two slightly immoral phone calls later posing as a concerned sister and Cass had her answer; Emma had not shown up to class today. The professor had sounded similarly concerned, as apparently Emma had a fairly flawless attendance record. Cass tried to provide what reassurance she could, then moved on to police reports and chatter. Nothing significant or related for today, so it was really just a wash.

Cass took some time out of her busy day of worrying to eat some dinner and prepare for the meeting at 11:30. She could hardly taste the food and the world looked slightly more grey than it normally did. Even the harsh yellow glow of the streetlamps seemed muted.

                            <span class="markdown">The hotel was on a different train line than the one nearest her apartment, so she would have to be careful to make sure she was back before the last train passed the transfer station at 1:30. Two hours wasn’t a long time, but it should be enough. Hopefully. She’d have to leave the hotel by 1:00 to be safe, or 1:15 at the latest as it was a bit of a walk. Missing the train wouldn’t be fatal, but it would be a major hassle if she had to try and get a cab at that time of night in that part of the city that didn’t want to cause problems. It would be much better if she were just on the train on time.

So, how should she handle this?

Cass entered the hotel lobby at 11:23 and sat down to wait in the richly decorated lounge nearby. An employee asked if he could help her, but she just told him she was waiting for someone. The lobby was sparsely populated, with the two employees at the front desk as well as an older gentleman reading quietly in the corner, a youngish couple drinking wine and giggling to each other, and a larger man seemingly passed out on one of the couches. A nearby bar was sectioned off by a velvet rope and a flight of stairs, but sounded much more busy. A tuxedoed man leaned against the wall near the rope and casually scanned the area.

Cass glanced around again, feeling underdressed. She was wearing a basic outfit - jeans and a T-shirt - while those around her were dressed in evening gowns, tuxedos, or suit jackets. She hadn’t expected the Celestial Hotel to be quite so upper class, given what neighborhood it was in. She kept feeling like everyone in the room had their eyes on her, but would look away a moment before she turned. Cass shrank in her seat, distinctly uncomfortable.

At 11:32, Emma walked into the hotel. She was wearing a slim black dress that sparkled with stars and constellations as she moved. Two men in grey suit coats followed a few steps behind her, clearly her escort. Emma headed straight for Cass, diverting only slightly to sit down in an armchair facing her.

She didn’t start the conversation the way Cass had been expecting - something nonchalant would have been understandable, or a mention of their shared dream last night, or even just “hello.” No, what Emma started off with was a quick whisper of “do you have your doll?”

Before Cass could respond, Emma continued as her guards rounded the couches and took up positions within earshot nearby. “I’m glad you made it,” she said at a normal volume. “Though I notice you didn’t dress up for the occasion. Didn’t think this would be a high-class enough outing?”

Emma gestured at one of the guards. “I thought you might have missed that part, so I brought a change of clothes if you’re interested.” The man pulled a clear plastic bag out of a hidden pocket sewn into his coat, revealing a dark shimmering dress similar to Emma’s. The girl leaned closer to Cass, lowering her voice somewhat. “In fact, this dress has a limited special property - it can let you reach through it to somewhere else for a few seconds. Maybe to grab something you forgot?” She leaned back and paused a moment. “Like some lipstick or makeup, perhaps.” 

Cass wasn’t sure how to read Emma’s expression, much less the offer of a dress. This meeting had already gotten pretty far away from what she had expected, and they had hardly even started. What doll was Emma referring to, and why had she whispered the question so quietly before her escorts had arrived? Maybe she should clear some things up first?

What should Cass do?

<img class="emoji " alt="👗" title="👗" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f457.png" /> - Accept the dress. Change in the bathroom.
<img class="emoji " alt="👕" title="👕" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f455.png" /> - Keep her current clothes.

The following actions are not mutually exclusive and require five votes to choose:
<img class="emoji " alt="🕳" title="🕳" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f573.png" /> - Summon something using the dress. [Specify what to summon. Requires accepting the dress.]
<img class="emoji " alt="💬" title="💬" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4ac.png" /> - Ask what the plan is for the rest of the meeting.
<img class="emoji " alt="❓" title="❓" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/2753.png" /> - Ask what the dress is made of - how does it work?
<img class="emoji " alt="🤵" title="🤵" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f935.png" /> - Ask about the men in suits. Who are they? Why are they here?
<img class="emoji " alt="🎎" title="🎎" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f38e.png" /> - Ask about the doll. What did she mean?

“I- okay. Sure.” Cass accepted the dress from the guard and placed it on her lap. “But before that, I want to clear some things up first.” She paused a moment to gather her thoughts. “First of all, what’s the plan for this meeting? Second, what did you mean when you asked about a doll?”

Cass saw what looked an awful lot like a flicker of panic cross Emma’s face, but it was quickly hidden. “First, I didn’t ask about a doll,” she said. “I said ‘we’re going to have a <em>ball</em>.’ You must have misheard. Anyway, that’s part of what we’re doing tonight as well. A little drinking, a little dancing, a little talking. Hopefully enough information shared to get us on the same side.”

Cass blinked. Had she imagined the brief expression? One of the guards shifted restlessly. “Oh...kay. I’ll, uh, get changed then. Be right back.” She stood and quickly walked to the bathroom, eager to leave the awkwardly tense atmosphere behind. The bathroom was empty, thankfully, so she could claim the largest stall without feeling marginally guilty. Cass quickly disrobed and slipped the dress on, shivering at its ghostly smooth touch. It wasn’t made of any normal fabric, that was for sure. She jammed her clothes back into the plastic bag and stepped out of the stall to check her appearance.

In the mirror, Cass looked as ethereal as the dress felt. It was strapless, but held itself up effortlessly and luckily had a high enough neckline to cover the puncture wounds in her lower neck. It fell to the floor and covered her shoes, making it appear that she glided more than walked. The occasional glimmers of light in the fabric shifted as she moved, and almost certainly even when she didn’t. Cass herself seemed almost devoid of color in comparison, a pale ghost draped in a robe of deep space black. She wasn’t entirely sure how she felt about the outfit; as covering as it was, she still felt very exposed.

                            <span class="markdown">Still, it wasn’t the most uncomfortable Cass had been this week, by far.

However, before she went back out there, she had to decide how she wanted the night to go. Emma was a mystery, with her whispering, half-glimpsed expressions, and denial of words Cass had heard clearly. Before too much else happened, Cass had to decide whether she wanted to trust Emma or not. At least as an initial judgement, to be revised later.

What are Cass’s feelings towards Emma? [This choice is not permanent and will be revisited later. This is merely an initial impression that mostly affects how Cass will respond during conversations between choices.]

Emma offered her arm as Cass returned to the group, saying “See, you look great. Come on, let’s head in.” With some hesitation, Cass accepted the proffered arm and gave the plastic bag to one of the guards. The two then began to walk towards the bar area Cass had noticed earlier, the guards trailing a few paces behind.

The bouncer seemed to recognize Emma or the guards, and waved them through without interrogation. Then it was just down the steps and into a dim room lit primarily by indirect neon-esque LEDs and packed with smartly dressed people. Many sat at the island bar, others at tables scattered throughout the room, and still others danced in pairs or in groups on an honest to god light up disco-esque floor. Cass paused a moment in surprise but Emma dragged her on to sit at one of the tables in a quieter section farther from the dance floor.

Emma picked up a menu and handed one to Cass. “Don’t worry about the cost; I’m paying. But before we get started here, I don’t think we’ve ever been formally introduced.” She extended her hand for a shake. “Hi Cass, I’m Emma, and I’m here to talk to you about the Order. I’m sure you knew that already, however, given your skills in investigating.”

Cass shook Emma’s hand. “Hi Emma. It’s nice to meet you in person rather than in dreams. Are you doing okay after last night?”

Emma closed her eyes momentarily. “Not great, but well enough. Thanks for the save. I could have ended up like...” She trailed off and cleared her throat. “Anyway, I’m here to answer your questions and help convince you that the Order isn’t the menace you’re convinced it is. So why don’t you look over that menu and think about what you’d like me to answer.”

A few minutes later, after a waiter had taken their orders, Emma looked at Cass expectantly. Cass paused a moment, then spoke. “What’s the point of all this?” she asked. “There’s been a lot more activity from the Order recently, or at least it’s been more visible. Why? What’s the goal?”

Emma half-glanced at one of the guards before answering. “It’s a summoning, of a sort. You know the significance of June 21st, I’m sure, and that’s when it will be complete. The solstice holds and focuses old magic of the sort we need.”

“So what’s the end result of the summoning?”

Emma shuffled her feet uncomfortably. “Change, Cass. Humanity isn’t good at doing what’s right without being tricked a little, because doing the right thing is never as easy as the wrong thing, or at least the lazy thing. People need a common enemy to unite against and organize a unified front. And there’s not much that’s more of a common enemy than an extremely violent semi-god from before the human race. With the right PR spin, any problem we want can be blamed and tackled. Drape some plastic wrap on, suddenly it’s global warming’s fault. Sprinkle in some gold coins, maybe it’s corrupt politicians or exploitative working conditions. No one will know where it actually came from, so whatever real, actual problem we choose to scapegoat can be targeted and eliminated. It’s not the most elegant solution, but it’s bound to be more effective than empty promises.”

Cass blinked slowly as Emma chuckled self-consciously. “I’m sure you realize that sounds completely insane, right?”

                            <span class="markdown">“Well, sure, but what’s the alternative? Let this planet exhale its last dying gasps without a struggle? You may not know this, but it’s all falling apart. The Dreamlands are collapsing into the waking world. The crust is unstable and crumbling into the mantle. Some portions of the atmosphere are actively poisonous. The list goes on. Some of these problems are magical, some aren’t. Without a wake up call, people won’t act until it’s too late, whether these people are world leaders or powerful magicians hidden in their lairs.”

“I... sure. Okay. But why me? Why Ben? You attacked us, possibly killed him, and left me for dead. What do you want with me, and what did you want with him?”

Emma seemed taken aback by Cass’s accusation. “The Order attacked you like that? I haven’t been involved with your case until fairly recently, since last Monday when we met at the college, but I haven’t heard of anything like that. Is that why you’ve been so focused on investigating?”

Cass gave a half-shrug as she felt her throat constricting as she thought of Ben. “Partly. It’s also a good story.”

“Fair. Well, I don’t know why there would have been an attack beforehand, but recently we’ve been interested in your due to your increasing involvement with magic and increasing knowledge of what we’re doing. I saw you with that waif; that was the first sign. Only people involved with magic to a pretty high degree can see them, and I believe you’re pretty new to this, so you must be special. Then you started following me in the Dreamlands. We figured you’d be a pretty formidable opponent, so I left you a message and you know the rest.”

“So you don’t know anything about... Ben?”

                            <span class="markdown">“Unfortunately not.” Cass wasn’t entirely sure, and it could have been the lighting, but she thought she saw Emma’s face flushing slightly as she said that. “I can ask around about it, though.” One of the guards coughed and she glanced nervously in his direction. He didn’t appear to be paying attention, however, sipping some sort of drink at the next table over, still easily within earshot.

The waiter returned with their food. Emma seemed grateful for the distraction, or perhaps just hungry. What should Cass say? [The top three questions will be chosen.]

⁉ - Push harder. She knows something about Ben.
<img class="emoji " alt="🔥" title="🔥" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f525.png" /> - Ask about the arson. Is Emma the perpetrator?
<img class="emoji " alt="🐟" title="🐟" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f41f.png" /> - Ask about the fish and the beast. Why was Emma hunting them?
<img class="emoji " alt="🔪" title="🔪" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f52a.png" /> - Ask about Dr Biers. Was the Order behind his attacks?
<img class="emoji " alt="✨" title="✨" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/2728.png" /> - Ask about the summoning magic. How can they control the summoned semi-god?
<img class="emoji " alt="📷" title="📷" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4f7.png" /> - Ask for clarification regarding the waif and magic. Why does she think Cass is special?
<img class="emoji " alt="🎎" title="🎎" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f38e.png" /> - Push harder about the dolls. Ask again, more forcefully.
<img class="emoji " alt="❓" title="❓" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/2753.png" /> - Something else. [Write-in]

“So going back to the summoning thing, how are you planning on controlling this god thing? What’s stopping it from killing people or destroying the world?”

Emma took a sip of water. “Powerful wards built into the ritual we’re using the summon it. There’s a reason I’ve been out chasing fish and beasts. They’re important ingredients needed to make this safe. We’re following the ancient procedures documented for this kind of thing, and the world hasn’t been destroyed yet. It should be fine.”

“Okay, so you’re not wanting to kill people. Then why attack Dr Biers? Someone from the Order tried to kill us both, and planted a... a void heart, I think, to control him and trick me. I’d call that pretty hypocritical.”

“Okay, that one sounds pretty bad, I admit. But would you believe I wasn’t involved in that one either?”

Cass raised an eyebrow. “Really.”

“Yeah, I wouldn’t believe me either.” Emma sighed. “No, I had heard. Biers is one of the most dangerous kinds of people around here: stubborn, misguided, and worst of all, knowledgeable. He’s powerful with magic, thinks the Order can do no good, and won’t accept any attempts to show him otherwise. With the date of the ritual approaching and operations getting more and more delicate, it was decided he had to be stopped. That... obviously didn’t go so well, and you got caught in the crossfire. Our new strategy with him is live and let live. He seems a lot more content to not be involved after that event, so as long as he stays away for another week, it’ll be fine. I think it helps having you involved so he feels less guilty about doing nothing.”

“Okay, so speaking of me, then. You said something about me and the waif, and that you thought I was special. What did you mean?”

                            <span class="markdown">Cass caught another slight flush as Emma answered. “Well, as I said, you need to be fairly immersed in magic to see waifs, and as far as I know, you only just got involved a week ago. That, plus your abilities in the Dreamlands, make you special. I’m not sure exactly in what way, but I’m sure you are.”

It didn’t take long to finish their food, talking about less consequential things, but when Cass checked the time, she was surprised to see it was already 12:30. They had been talking for an hour and she only had 30 minutes left to safely catch the train. She was almost ready to say something, but Emma interrupted her before she could say more than a few words. “Cass, come on. You’re on a night out with a new friend and you’re wanting to leave without even dancing a little? Come on, let me have at least one song?” Emma again glanced quickly at the closest guard, sitting nonchalantly at the nearest table and sipping his drink.

Should Cass accept?

Cass hesitated a moment, then acquiesced, taking Emma’s hand allowing her to take the lead towards the floor. One of the guards stood to come with, but Emma glared and waved him back. After a hesitant pause, he sat back down and uttered his first word of the evening. “Be careful. We’ll be watching.”

Emma chuckled as they walked away. “They’re so overprotective. What’s going to happen here, of all places? Still, they’re paid to be careful, so I can’t stay mad at them.” She paused a moment as they arrived to listen to the song playing. “Hm, a little slow but an interesting choice, I guess. Do you know the steps?”

Cass shook her head. “I’m not much of a dancer.”

“Nonsense! I’ll lead, come on.” Emma grasped her other hand and led Cass onto the floor, soon maneuvering into the middle of the crowd. Cass clumsily attempted to follow along, though it seemed like Emma was distracted as well, glancing quickly over her shoulder. She lowered her voice and pulled in closer, speaking quietly and quickly.

“Cass, you have to help me. I need to get away from that cult, and those two are guarding me to stop me from getting away. I don’t think they know for sure that I’m going to make a break for it just yet, but they’re definitely suspicious. I can’t talk long - they’ve got absurd hearing - so please just listen for now.

“Some of what I told you was true - the solstice, the summoning, the waif, Dr Biers, your... uniqueness.” Cass caught an unreadable look from Emma at that last part, as she looked up into Cass’s eyes and held her gaze for a moment before turning away. “Some of it was propaganda. I couldn’t be truthful with them present. Please, help me get away from them and we can stop this mad plan together.”

Cass squeezed Emma’s hand. “I’ll help you,” she whispered. An instant later, she spun around, pulling Emma with her, yelling something about a man with a gun. She ducked her head down as she ran, concentrating as best she could amongst the noise and panic. Cass knew she was capable; she knew this was possible. She just had to... there!

The sound of a pistol shot cracked through the space and the crowd screamed as one. People scattered in every direction, fleeing madly towards any possible exits. Emma, quickly understanding what Cass was trying to do, pulled her away from the original course to duck around the bar and into a back hallway. Cass wasn’t sure who was pulling who anymore as the two sprinted towards a set of metal doors near the end of the corridor. Emma smashed the elevator call button as she slowed ungracefully to a stop, tripping over her dress. 

“Do you have your doll?” Emma asked urgently as she tried to catch her breath. “This is going to be dangerous and I don’t want you to get hurt.”

Cass shook her head, panting for air. “No, why? Actually, nevermind that; what’s the plan from here?”

Emma swore quietly then recovered her composure. “Okay, if you don’t have yours, you’ve got to stay safe, okay? Even if it means I don’t make it out. We’re going up to the roof first, then down through a different building; they’ll have the exits covered here. I’ll lead the way.”

The elevator dinged and the doors opened. Emma and Cass darted inside, pressing the button for the 24th floor. The doors slowly started to close, but not fast enough. One of the guards appeared at the end of the hallway, wielding a pistol a lot less illusory than the sound Cass had just summoned. He extended his arms and fired twice before the door could close.

                            <span class="markdown">The bullets flew true, a glittering silver trail marking their path towards their target. Emma let out a gasp and fell to the floor, deep red blood pooling quickly. The elevator started to rise. Time seemed to move in slow motion.

Cass knelt and leaned close, her mind spinning and the beginnings of tears forming in her eyes. Emma was attempting to speak, but her voice was breathless and weak. “Cass...” she managed to whisper, her eyes squeezed shut against the pain. “Please...”

Then she was gone. Her hand dropped to the floor and her muscles relaxed. Several seconds passed, then her entire body began to glow, then burn, then fade. 

Cass watched, horrified, as Emma’s body burned away like ashes from a fire, leaving behind only a little doll in a starry black dress with her exact features stitched onto the face with unbelievable precision.

What should Cass do? It’s hard to focus or think. This doesn’t seem real.
[Cass’s mental state is at dangerous levels. Negative effects will result. Be careful.]

Cass reached down and picked up the doll, watching a tear drop onto the elevator floor as she did so. The doll felt warm, almost hot, and she grasped it tightly in her hand to keep ahold of some sort of sensation in this numb, unreal world.

She stopped the elevator on the eighth floor and stepped out into a scene of chaos. Hotel guests were running towards the stairs and stopping, cramming up against the doors and unable to move further due to the crush of people already in the stairwell from the other levels. The atmosphere was tense as people darted this way and that, trying to find some faster way to escape. Someone noticed Cass’s elevator and within seconds, a screaming crowd shoved past her into the car, knocking Cass to the ground. She clenched her teeth against the pain, light though it was. At least it was something to know she still existed.

Cass slowly picked herself up and stumbled into one of the open doors nearby, rifling through the closet. She found a light tan jacket and a beanie that would fit. It would have to do. Cass bundled up her hair into the beanie until it was hidden entirely, then wrapped the jacket around the dress. She checked her appearance in the mirror. Odd, but hopefully unrecognizable, at least from the waist up. She couldn’t find anything to hide the lower portion of the dress, as whoever was staying here wore clothes much too large for Cass.

From there, it was an interminable wait to reach the foyer. Elevators continued traveling up and down for a few more minutes before they were shut off, and then it was just the stairs. Cass slowly and silently made her way down with the rest of the crowd, directed unceremoniously out onto the street by a police officer. The grey-suited guards were nowhere to be seen.

                            <span class="markdown">Cass slipped away into the night. It was too late for the train she had meant to catch, but she needed some time to be alone with her thoughts anyway. She walked the ten miles back to her apartment, thinking of nothing interspersed with images of those last few moments in the elevator car. As the night wore on, she grew thirsty, hungry, tired. Cass drew in the uncomfortable sensations and used them to be sure she was alive. She relished the dull throb of the oncoming headache, the slow-burning tension in her legs. If these ever went away, she would be lost.

Cass arrived back at some time in the morning; she didn’t bother to check. She gently placed Emma’s doll on her nightstand, right next to her own, then collapsed into bed without even bothering to take off the jacket or beanie. A dim light grew in her mind as she slipped into sleep, ethereal and hazy. It pulsed with the beat of her heart, white, then red. Silk tainted with blood.

The light grew brighter and closer. Cass could feel her dream-body now, curled up and shivering on a cold rocky floor and gazing up at the slowly descending light. She could almost cry. She was so tired. Tired of this nightmare the world had spiralled into over the past few weeks. 

She could give up. It would be so easy. Just to lie back down and close her eyes. Surrender to the nightmares and wait for the end. It wouldn’t be long, now. She just... had... to... give... up.

<em>Fuck that.</em>

Cass shoved against the floor, her arms shuddering against the crushing weight on her back as she slowly pushed herself up. She could sit, then kneel, then stand. Her knees strained but she stood tall against the shadows surrounding her and refused to bend. Cass let out a raw-throated yell of anguish and ripped down the collar of the starry dress she still wore, allowing the golden light to burst forth from her neck. She screamed again and jumped into the air, streamers of fiercely shining gold trailing from her limbs.

She flew upwards, into the beating heart of the storm gathered above. Lightning arced around her, but she deflected the bolts, channeling the energy down through the streamers into the rock below. Her form blazed with a golden halo and Cass saw herself searing the dark clouds, boiling them away into space. The core of the storm was close.

Suddenly the clouds cleared and Cass slowed a moment, taken aback despite herself. A partly-transparent sac hung from the ceiling of a massive cavern, cloudy with a pale purple fluid. Something writhed and swam unpleasantly in it. A forceful presence beat against her mind, dimming her glow. Cass could feel tears running down her face as she shouted out a wordless challenge to the thing and launched herself forward. A golden sword formed in her hand from the streamers of brilliant light and she grasped the hilt, preparing to swing. Cages hung from the ceiling, tiny in the distance. Quiet screams echoed around her.

                            <span class="markdown"><em>For Ben.</em> Cass swung at the sac, slashing a tear in the side. She staggered in midair under an agonizing mental blow.

<em>For Emma.</em> Cass swung again, carving another gash. Fluid burst from the sac and spilled over her form, scalding and burning like acid.

<em>For me.</em> Cass drove the sword deep into the sac, up to the hilt. Something snapped above her and the entire assembly fell from the ceiling, crashing to the ground with Cass tangled up in it. Her glow was nearly extinguished, her mind and body alike aflame with agonizing torment.

The ground came rushing up to meet her broken body with another wave of unbearable pain and she sank into darkness, watching the death throes of the maggot-creature she had just slain.

...

Day broke eventually and Cass slowly opened her eyes, squinting against the glare. She felt... lighter. And healthy. No aches, pains, or injuries. She carefully stretched her arm over to her nightstand to grab her phone, then checked the date.

Cass paused a moment, then opened her eyes wide and bolted upright. It is now 7AM on Sunday, June 20th, and the summer solstice is tomorrow. She had been asleep for five days. She looked around her room, wild-eyed, to see what had changed as she had been sleeping, and the surprises kept mounting.

                            <span class="markdown">Her previous outfit had gone, leaving Cass in the same flowing red dress her doll had worn. The waif lay by her feet, now stretching and mewing happily at her movement. Specks of pitch-black blood dotted the sheets around the creature, and wisps of shadowy grey jelly hinted at what it had been fighting. Its fur stuck up at odd angles, but it otherwise looked perfectly healthy. Cass allowed it to rub against her hand as she surveyed the rest of the room. The dolls on the nightstand had gone as well, and Cass felt a pang of mixed sadness and fear as she noticed the tiny twin piles of ash that had replaced them. Finally, the last surprise came as she rolled over to get out of bed and she nearly stepped on Emma, alive, still wearing her starry black dress and quietly sleeping on the floor. A voice tickled the edge of Cass’s awareness, faint and indistinct.

As difficult as it was to leave Emma lying there, Cass decided she would need all the rest she could get and quietly stepped out of her room. Some cleaning and cooking later and she sat alone at the table, eating a large breakfast and reading up on events since the night of the 14th. 

Four people had died at the hotel that night, and nine more had been injured. The majority had died from trampling or crushing, but one girl who somewhat resembled Cass had been shot by the grey-suited guards. Both had escaped and were still at large, having apparently gone into hiding. Cass thought back to Biers and how he said the cult had contacts in the police, and she quietly doubted the men would ever be caught.

In the days afterwards, the weather had worsened, but cult activities had cratered. There was one report of a suspicious vessel in the bay, but beyond that nothing visible had happened between then and now. Cass also checked her email, ignoring the multitude from work (she’d get to it later) and noticing one from the firearm shop saying her gun had been ready to pick up on Tuesday. Suddenly thinking better of it, Cass quickly sent an email to her boss saying that she had been in an unexpected accident and would be out for another few days, but would explain everything afterwards. She scanned through the rest of the news, but there really was nothing else of note besides a threateningly strong thunderstorm forecasted for tonight. The Order had gone dark in preparation for the day of the ritual.

Suddenly Cass became aware of someone watching her. She turned to spot Emma standing in the doorway to the kitchen, wearing an expression crossed between joyful relief and fearful concern. Cass stood and walked towards her, stopping a few feet away and breaking the silence. “You’re alive.”

                            <span class="markdown">Emma rushed forward and hugged Cass tightly. “That’s my line,” she sobbed. “I could see, through the doll. You died too. For five days I was trapped in there, waiting for my body to regenerate, while you laid dead just beside me! And then I woke up and your doll was gone too and...”

Cass hugged Emma back. “It’s okay. We’re both here now, alive and together. And I intend for us to remain that way.”

Emma sniffled. “How can you be so calm, Cass? You’re so... mature.”

Cass started guiding Emma to a seat at the table. “I’m not calm. I’ve just... been through a lot these past few days.”

Emma looked up as she sat down. “What happened in your dream? What did you go through?” She paused and looked down. “What killed you?”

Breakfast passed quickly as Cass filled Emma in on what had happened during her latest visit to the Dreamlands, and what the Order had been up to in the meantime. Emma, in turn, explained how the dolls worked, though she had already guessed much of it. They acted as a sort of extra life, if they were close enough to the bearer when they died. After five days, the doll would burn to ash and the bearer would be reborn. The trick was where they came from. These dolls were only acquired in dreams, and only in encounters such as Cass’s with her older self. They couldn’t be made, sought out, or traded. Only those “touched by the light beyond” could get one.

With that comment, Emma lifted her shirt to show Cass a familiar pair of puncture wounds on the left side of her torso, unnervingly similar to Cass’s wounds on her neck. Emma admitted she didn’t know much about where the wounds came from or how they worked, but those marked in this way both emitted light in the Dreamlands and possessed some unique attributes in magic.

                            <span class="markdown">Beyond that, Emma explained a little more about the ritual. She seemed convinced that if the Order had gone dark for the past few days, they must already have all of the components they would need to complete the summoning. The two of them would only have until noon tomorrow to interfere, as that was when the solstice’s energy would be the strongest and thus when the summoning would conclude. Whatever creature the Order summoned, Emma knew it would never be used for the sort of purposes she had mentioned at the hotel. It would either break free and kill millions in a rampage, or it would be used to conquer. They had to stop the ritual before its completion, and to do that would involve physical interference. The Order had a headquarters in and below a warehouse near the docks, and Emma knew where it was and where they would be performing the ritual. Today, they just had to prepare.

With all of that in mind, what will Cass (and Emma) do today? [There are three action slots available and each choice will confer unique benefits for the final challenge. The top-voted choices will be implemented.]

Afterwards, they would go over the magical side of things, doing some research on the entity the cult was intending to summon and how they might be able to stop it if things came to that.

It didn’t take long to make it to the store and pick up the weapon, a small and sleek pistol that Cass promised she absolutely definitely would not be carrying on the streets outside of its locked case for transport only, as she wasn’t licensed for that. The clerk sighed but let her have it anyway once all the requisite forms were filled. She had the gun, a suppressor, a concealed holster, and enough ammunition to last through tomorrow at least. It would be enough. She technically wouldn’t be carrying it on the streets, anyway; she’d be carrying it in and under a warehouse against those who would bring about the end of the world.

Cass stepped out into the street, glancing worriedly at the dark storm clouds gathering on the horizon, then headed for the train station. Before she arrived, however, she got a phone call. She pulled her phone out and was concerned to see it was her boss, Terry, calling; she couldn’t realistically ignore that.

“Cass, you can’t keep ignoring me,” he said when she picked up. “Not until you explain why you sent that long email about the cult five days ago, why you’ve been unreachable since then, and why you just now sent another email saying you’d explain everything later. What the hell is going on, Cass? Is what you said true? Are you in danger? What’s happening tonight?”

Cass ducked into the shadows between two buildings, trying to get slightly more privacy for this conversation than just being out on the streets. “It’s true, Terry, and it’s worse than I had imagined. The cult’s real and it’s going to do something big and dangerous tomorrow at noon, on the solstice. I’ve been out the last few days trying to deal with someone who wants to hurt me, but don’t worry. I have this under control. I’ve got a friend on the inside and we’re going to a particular warehouse by the docks soon to stop this before it happens.”

There was silence on the line for a few seconds. “Cass... I know I can’t change your mind on this, since that’s the kind of person you are. But you’ve gotta be careful, alright? I’m willing to trust you on this for another day, but if I don’t hear from you by Tuesday at the latest, I’m calling the cops no matter what you said in your email.”

“Thanks, Terry. Hopefully by Tuesday it’ll all be over and we can talk this over in person.”

“Alright, I’m sure you’ve got lots to do so I’ll let you go now, but remember Tuesday at the latest, okay?”

“I’ll remember. Goodbye.”

“...Bye.”

Cass stared into the cloudy grey sky on the train ride back. She had a sneaking suspicion she might not make it back from this, and based on Terry’s tone of voice, he had a similar inkling. Briefly, she wondered what death would be like, with all the magic and dreams she had encountered over the past few weeks. Then she shook those thoughts away. She was alive, and she intended to stay that way.

...

Emma had constructed a fairly substantial map by the time Cass got back, having commandeered several large sheets of paper and the entirety of the kitchen table to draw out a large outline of the warehouse that was their target. She had traced three paths through the complex towards a central area that she explained was a common area that doubled as the ritual chamber.

                            <span class="markdown">The first route was very direct. It involved breaching the upper level of the warehouse, avoiding or neutralizing the probable guards present, then descending via a staircase in the corner to the lower level. After that, it would be a straight shot through a main corridor to a mudroom of sorts, after which the central chamber was only a door away.

The second route was more obscure. This one involved entering through the water side of a secret marina hidden by the illusion of a rock wall. Once there, it involved avoiding or neutralizing any guards present before entering a series of storage rooms and holding cells. Past those, it would be a straight shot through a main corridor before reaching the central chamber.

The third route was certainly the outlier of the three. It also considered the marina, but instead of entering via the docks, Emma pointed out a hidden intake tunnel she was fairly confident only a handful of cultists knew about - primarily the custodian and maintenance personnel. This underwater tunnel led through a series of turbines into a machine room near the central chamber. From there, the two could either climb a set of stairs to enter the same mudroom as in the first route, or they could swim straight up into the pool located in the center of the ritual chamber.

Which route should the two pick, and should they attempt a direct or hidden approach? Additionally, what time should they schedule the attack?

The plan was set: Emma and Cass would sneak in via the maintenance intake this evening, just after sunset, then attempt to disrupt the ritual somehow. They likely wouldn’t be able to interrupt the actual casting given the timing, but perhaps stealing a component, incapacitating a key caster, or something like that would work. That did, however, mean that the two wouldn’t have a lot of time to prepare before it was time to go. Bearing that in mind, Emma and Cass lost no time researching the entity the cultists were most likely trying to summon as the afternoon wore on and the storm promised for the evening gathered outside.

Emma didn’t have all the information, but based on clues she had gleaned, she and Cass agreed the most likely entity in play tonight would be Bholgalos, also known as the Maw of the Ocean and the Burrower Beneath. Bholgalos’ status was hotly debated in the occult community; some called him a Greater Demon, while others referred to him as a Lesser God. Signs of his coming were purported to be unseasonable storms and torrential rainfall, along with nightmarish dreams. He commanded legions of what were termed the “Bloated,” after the unpleasant decay processes that occurred after a death at sea. These beings generally appeared as fat, puffy pale creatures of various shapes and sizes, all vicious and deadly, as well as disruptive to magic. Legends held that with his power over storms and dreams, and with an army of bloated monstrosities at his command, Bholgalos very nearly succeeded in conquering the world at some point in the distant past, only eventually defeated and sealed away by a trio of ancient Elder Gods now long since passed into dust.

                            <span class="markdown">Needless to say, it would be disastrous for the world if Bholgalos were to escape his bonds. This, however, appeared to be exactly what the Order was attempting to accomplish. The signs of his presence, the level of power, the bloated creatures Cass had seen in her dreams, it all fit together. The only missing portion of the legends was what might be effective in stopping his return.

Ah. That.

There were some infuriatingly vague hints at a secret component for the summoning, without which (or with which? It was hard to tell) the ritual would not only fail but backfire and re-energize the bonds holding Bholgalos at bay for another thousand years, but there just seemed to be no solid information available as to what it was. Similarly, there was no advice to be had on how one might banish Bholgalos should the ritual be completed and he be summoned into the world. That, it seemed, would be game over. Still, time was moving quickly and the two had to stop before too long in order to still keep to their window of opportunity. Cass and Emma grabbed their supplies and jumped on a train headed to the waterfront, both hardly speaking but each grappling with their own fears of what lay ahead.

Cass and Emma went over the topic of magic on the train ride. Bholgalos, rituals, components, spells, and general magical information were all reviewed and corrected. By the time the train reached the station, both felt slightly more confident in their ability to recognize and deal with magical threats. [Relevant checks will get a +10% bonus.]

It was about a ten minute walk from the train station to the warehouse that would be their target. Along the way, the cloud-covered sky finally broke open, spilling a rapidly growing deluge onto the earth. Cass and Emma pulled their coats tight and sloshed onwards. It was likely the rain wouldn’t let up until the summoning was complete. The sun had gone down and the clouds blotted out the moon completely; aside from the sparse streetlights, the night was completely black. The waif was here too, barely visible as a blurred shadow darting incorporeally between raindrops. They passed the warehouse, noting the night watchmen stationed at every door, each visible in a cone of sickly yellow radiance provided by security lights mounted above the entry points. They would not be going that way. 

The lake crashed against the docks, sending fans of foamy spray splashing onto the pier. Massive waves were visible in the harbor, stirred up by the growing storm. Emma pointed out the cliff that was their target, its grey bulk distinguished from the rest by a slight difference in the quality of the ocean spray than the rest of the cliffs; the illusion wasn’t perfect.

                            <span class="markdown">The entrance to the underground harbor was located under a cordoned-off section of the pier, enclosed by a barbed-wire fence. It would be difficult to make it in, but if they managed it, they could essentially drop down into the harbor directly. There were, however, other options. They could jump into the water from where they currently were, requiring about a 20 ft swim to make it to the illusory wall. However, the drop - either from the restricted zone or from their current location - was about 15 feet. Not much for experienced high-divers, but at night, into storm-thrashed waters, carrying equipment, and without  much experience, it might be a little much. Luckily, there was a ladder not far away leading down to the water level, but taking the ladder would necessitate a 50 ft swim to reach the illusory wall.

How should Emma and Cass reach the hidden harbor?

The swim through the storm-tossed water seemed interminable. Waves slapped Cass against the concrete pier and the water’s chill bit at her flesh. Emma was visible a few feet farther along, her bobbing head in the water barely illuminated by the reflection of the streetlights. The rock wall grew closer and closer, and then they were inside it. The illusion was intangible, but the inside looked like a twisted soup of black threads strung between the true walls of the cavern. Then they were through.

The illusion was partially transparent from this side, allowing Cass to see back out into the battered harbor. Rain beat heavily on the roof above and the water was still as frigid as outside. At least it wasn’t raining in here. The room was large, perhaps a hundred feet wide and fifty deep, with several boats moored at low wooden docks. Cass was able to recognize the Starfury, as well as several smaller craft. Past the docks, four steep flights of stairs and one long ramp led to an upper level containing a few tables and chairs scattered around a railing. Four people were sitting at one of the tables, laughing loudly at some outrageous play in their game of cards. None of them had yet noticed Cass and Emma, treading water quietly in the shadows just inside the illusory barrier.

Emma grabbed onto the cavern wall and motioned for Cass to do the same. They pressed up against the rock, as hidden as possible in the open area. “The tunnel is in between those two docks,” she said, pointing. “It’s about five feet below the waterline, and it’s a bit of a distance before we hit air again, so I’ll go first. Just follow my lead, okay?”

Cass nodded, shivering. “How are we going to get there? It’s out in the open.”

“Along the wall, come on.” Emma whispered, pulling herself forward and sticking close to the edge of the cavern. Cass carefully followed suit, moving slowly to avoid any splashing. She felt so exposed, looking up at the docks above and hearing the raucous laughter continuing. Someone yelled something else, but the sound of the rain and the waves prevented her from making out the words.

Another shout, this one clearer. “No way, man! You’ll just lose ‘em!”

Someone responded. “I’ll buy you more, come on. I can make it! Here, watch me!”

A clattering sounded from above as chairs moved back. Cass looked up again and saw the four guards all standing at the railing, looking towards the boat nearest the open water. One held a series of knives in his hand and was aiming very carefully at something she couldn’t see. Cass gulped and ducked down in the water, eyeing the remaining distance. Still at least a third of the way to go.

The guard threw the knife and it splashed into the water. Everyone groaned and started talking over each other. “Man, you call that a throw?” “Markus, gimme a knife.” “I can do better, come on!” The guards jostled around as knives were distributed until someone was knocked backwards and turned around the opposite direction, chuckling the entire time before it became a coughing gasp as his eyes widened.

Cass squeaked and ducked under the water, swimming aggressively towards the dock as shouts erupted from above. She popped up in the darkness under the docks, breathing heavily and searching for Emma by the slight glimpses of light leaking between the planks. The other girl seemed similarly worried, pressed up against the concrete of the pier and listening to the stomping footsteps on the wood above them as the guards descended, shouting about intruders.

“Go for the tunnel, quick! You said they don’t know about it!” Cass whispered, feeling her shoes touch the bottom with relief. Emma nodded and quickly darted through the water to the left. Cass followed suit as fast as she was able while shouting continued above. The tunnel entrance was below the waterline, as Emma had described. She toggled her headlamp and dove in, motioning for Cass to do the same.

Cass swam quickly but carefully, trying to conserve her air as she wasn’t sure how long the tunnel would be. Silent turbines slid by in the darkness, encrusted with weeds and rust. They clearly had been lying dormant for years. She could feel some sort of presence ahead, pushing out but also drawing her closer. A smothering sensation, like being pulled into a pillow. Then, quite suddenly, Emma had disappeared from in front of her. Cass looked up and saw the ripple of her light across the surface of the water and pulled herself out of the tunnel, taking deep breaths to recover from the extended swim.

The room she now found herself in was rather small, maybe the size of a medium office. Old rusted tools and sheet metal were stacked against the right hand wall, while the far wall had an old metal door secured with a rusted padlock and chain. Cass spared a second to wonder why the door was locked from the inside before continuing to survey the rest of the room. The left hand and rear walls were blank, the former dingy concrete and the latter solid rock. There was a low stone arch set into the wall to the right of the door in the front wall, allowing access to a small well filled with gently rippling water.

That door goes to the prep room just outside it, but it wasn’t locked last time I was here. I don’t know why the lock they used is so old, either. Still-” she walked over to the lock and examined it. “We’re here now and they know it. I’m also completely freezing from all this water; don’t know about you. What now?”

Cass felt herself vibrating in tune with some extracosmic note, close now. There was powerful magic nearby. It felt blocked somehow, however, groping at her clumsily, unable to find a foothold. Her body was chilled to the bone, but she could feel a burning flame of golden light beginning to stir within her. She touched her neck and was unsurprised to find it hot, in stark contrast to the rest of her skin. The presence had no power over her in the realm of dreams and magic, but it was quickly approaching the physical world, and much faster than she had anticipated. Closing her eyes, Cass could almost make out a towering form, striding down a long corridor woven of threads of light stitched together to keep clouds at bay. The summoning was in progress, and they didn’t have long. The voice is louder here, more clear. And there are two of them.

The voices grew loud but Cass turned away, shutting them out. She had more important things to focus on than which terrible idea was correct. She pressed against the wall, noting in a detached sort of way that she was now visibly glowing, wreathed in a dim golden light. “Shh...” she breathed. “Listen.”

Faintly, from above. Voices, chanting. Calling a presence from beyond, shaping the tunnel that would guide him here. Emma and Cass had miscalculated; the ritual was already in progress and would be complete in a matter of minutes, perhaps a half hour. Of course the sun would interfere; its eldritch light was what overflowed from Cass and Emma through their wounds. The night still lent its power to the terrors, while the touch of day still banished them.

But still, there was a piece missing from the ritual, and that worried Cass enough to throw her mind out of the strange and ancient patterns she was lost in. For a moment, she returned to Earth, standing scared and cold in a dark basement, about to face down a group of dangerous lunatics with nothing more than a gun, a friend, and a hope.

Then the sunlight filled her veins again and she was drowned in the power she now wielded. The beyond was sliding closer to the real world, growing her power and deepening her connection every moment. If it got too close for too long, she risked being lost forever amongst the fiery infinity of the sun. Emma felt it too, she knew, but not to the same degree. 

“Let’s go,” Cass said, her voice echoing with magic. “Into the water, up into the chamber. Surprise them. It’s close to finished; you can feel that too, right?”

Emma nodded. Her form, too, was outlined in gold. “Something’s missing, though. What if we just leave them? It won’t work without that missing piece, right?”

The sunlight came in waves, making it hard to think. Did that make sense? Was it worth the risk? <em>Could</em> she even leave, after coming this far?

“No. We can’t leave now. This is the end, and we’ve got to make sure it fails. Even if there’s only a slim chance.”

Emma hesitated, then nodded. “You’re right. Let’s finish this.”

Cass slipped into the water, hardly feeling the chill through the radiant glow that now encompassed her form. It was a short swim and she had no trouble holding her breath for the twenty seconds or so it took to make it through the passage and up the shaft, into the pool that lay in the middle of the ritual chamber. She rose from the water, hovering in the midst of a burning halo. Cultists surrounded her on all sides, kneeling and chanting. Emma rose up behind her, not quite connected enough to the sun to fly, holding onto the side of the pool and pausing a moment before the calm shattered.

What was she going to do? Was she going to kill them? Cass wasn’t sure. And as she hesitated, the situation changed.

A hooded figure stood from the ring of cultists, robed in a deep red cloak. He stepped towards Cass and she felt the sun’s power shrinking, contained in a smaller and smaller area as he walked. He stopped maybe ten feet from her. She caught the barest hint of a grin under his hood.

“Oh Cass,” he said. “Always so quick to put the pieces together, but always in a rush. You missed something, dear.”

His voice. It was so familiar. Why... did she feel like she knew him?

“I’m sure you’ve got it all figured out now, of course. Now that it’s too late. I’m sure you’ve gathered that the missing ingredient is none other than you, dear. You and Emma and the sun’s power contained in your blood. With careful planning and careful containment, one can invert that power and use it against its own nature. To darken rather than illuminate. To dissolve boundaries rather than bolster them. I’m sure you’re starting to feel it now.”

                            <span class="markdown">He had begun pacing around the pool now, hands clasped behind his back. Cass could feel a deep burning sensation start to ignite in her chest, tracing a line from her wound to her heart and back again. She struggled to stay afloat.

“I really do owe this to you, Cass. All your deductions and dreamland escapades inspired Emma to chase you down, and that exposed her treachery. Who knows; maybe she could have brought this down if she hadn’t met such an inglorious end.” He waved to Emma. “Welcome back, by the way. I hope your death was painful.” 

Emma did not respond, her skin ashen and her limbs trembling with pain. “But I really think that the part I’m going to enjoy most about this whole process isn’t the summoning or your death, dear. It’s the look on your face when I pull back this hood.”

Ben smiled at Cass. “Show’s over, dear.”

Intuitive knowledge burned through Cass’s nerves along with the sun’s agony and the shock of revelation. She only had a few options, and she only had seconds to decide. Bholgalos would be entering the real world in a matter of moments, and that would be the end. She had to choose. [This is the final choice in the story.]

<img class="emoji " alt="💥" title="💥" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4a5.png" /> - Detonate the inverted sun’s energy with the force of a small nuclear bomb. Immolate herself, Emma, Ben, the cultists, and much of the city block. Prevent the end of the world.
<img class="emoji " alt="🌟" title="🌟" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f31f.png" /> - Utilize the conduit between worlds to channel what remains of her pure sun energy into the rift. Stop the ritual, at the cost of her own life. No one else has to die today.
<img class="emoji " alt="🔥" title="🔥" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f525.png" /> - Allow Emma to take her place and use her own connection to the sun to seal the rift. Stop the ritual, at the cost of Emma’s life.
<img class="emoji " alt="🌃" title="🌃" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f303.png" /> - Escape by sealing away a little pearl of the sun’s pure energy before it is consumed. Do not stop the ritual, but both Cass and Emma will have the chance to escape in the chaos of the aftermath.

Cass drifted down in the air until she was floating in the pool with Emma. The walls started to rumble, then shake. A pinpoint dot of black appeared in the center of the room, several meters above her head. The chanting reached a fever pitch.

Cass felt calm. She had made her choice. All that was left was to execute it. Her hand raised, the veins along her arm pulsing with deathly black energy. A slight pressure of her finger and the gunshot rang out. Ben clutched his chest and fell, obscured behind rows of cultists.

Cass let her hand drop. The gun splashed down into the water, its purpose served. The pinpoint of darkness above had grown to the size of a marble. Howling winds flowed chaotically from one dimension to the next. Cass grabbed Emma’s wrist and leaned in, pressing their foreheads together so Emma would have to look into her eyes. “Hey.” Cass said, audible despite the roaring wind. “I’m sorry.”

Their lips met for the briefest moment and Cass closed her eyes, wishing she could extend that one precious second. A glow of warmth spread through her body and for an instant, she almost believed that things would be okay.

Then it was gone. “Goodbye,” she whispered, gingerly releasing her grip.

Emma’s eyes opened in confusion as Cass pulled back and rose into the air. “Wait- you can’t... what are you doing?!” she shouted, reaching out as if to grab Cass and pull her back down.

Cass floated level with the pinpoint, now grown into a disk the size of a dinner plate. A cacophony of colors and noises poured from the other side of the disk and she could feel the presence of an alien being, utterly unknown and larger than she could imagine. Bholgalos was here, pushing and prodding at the rift and teasing it open, bit by bit.

                        <div class="chatlog__content">
                            <span class="markdown">She paused one more moment, looking down at Emma’s distraught face below her, then hesitated no longer. A bubble of glowing golden light sprang into existence, encircling both Cass and the rift. Sounds and images from the outside grew muted and hazy, leaving her and the demon alone. She could feel her heartbeat slowly struggling against the poisoned sunlight sluggishly moving through her veins.

Cass closed her eyes and gave herself up, surrendering her energy, her power, her soul. All of it flowed from her into the golden barrier surrounding the rift. The pure sunlight remaining in her wasn’t enough, so she bolstered it, pouring in her vitality, her intellect, her hopes and dreams and personality. With each trait snuffed out, the barrier grew stronger and more solid. 

Towards the end, as Cass’s body crumbled, her mind grew frail, and her soul wore thin, Bholgalos seemed to catch on. She could feel a sense of urgency emanating from the portal, battering against her already fragile being until she was nearly spent. But finally, the barrier was complete. Cass dropped from the air, an empty, spent shell, and crashed into the pool of water. The golden bubble flared as bright as the sun, the ceiling broke open, and she knew no more.

Days later, Emma sits alone at Cass’s bedside. She still wears bandages on much of her body, and she still can’t walk without assistance. Regardless, she had demanded to be let out of her own room in the hospital to see her. The other girl looks terrible, her skin ashen grey and her body wasted away to the point of skin and bones. She has been in a coma for over a week now, but she still stubbornly clings to life. The doctor had told her that Cass’s brain activity is shockingly high, but there’s absolutely no response to stimuli. “It’s as if she’s trapped in a dream,” the doctor had said, unaware of the implications of her statement. Emma clasps her hands together to stop them shaking and wipes a tear away as she recalls the aftermath of the summoning.

Several cultists had scattered after Cass shot Ben, though the majority remained in their designated places, even as the ceiling began to collapse and bury people under mounds of rubble. Emma had recovered quickly after Cass sealed the rift in the sunlight orb, the burning pain bouncing between her wound and her heart lessening before being replaced with a coursing thrum of power.

She had tried to use her power to help Cass, to bolster the barrier and preserve some of the other girl’s energy, but before long the shield had gotten too thick and too bright to see if her efforts were having any effect. At that point, most of the cultists had scattered. Then the room had started to collapse and Emma realized that she would need to move quickly to save her own life, let alone do anything for Cass.

                        </div>



                        <div class="chatlog__content">
                            <span class="markdown">She had jumped out of the pool, sparing one more look over her shoulder at the miniature sun Cass had created, before sending another wave of power its way and running for her life. The ceiling had collapsed only a few seconds after she left the room, running up the stairs into the warehouse proper before being caught in the landslide as the entire complex collapsed into the central chamber. She didn’t remember much after that until waking up several hours later in a hospital bed, to which she had been confined until just a few minutes ago.

39 bodies had been pulled out of the wreckage, including several high-ranking members of the city government, Emma herself, and of course Cass, who had been found lying atop the rubble in the center of the destruction, comatose and nearly dead. Of the 39 casualties, 25 had died before rescue and 10 more died afterwards. Two cultists had survived, and they had confessed much of the truth behind the catastrophe. The incident had garnered national media attention. Notably, Ben’s body had not been located.

Emma shook herself out of her reverie, feeling more tears on her cheeks. There was still so much more to do! The cult wouldn’t have stopped here and given up; Emma knew there were many more than the 37 members that had been pulled from the wreckage. Plus, if Ben were still alive... And she still had school, and work, and a life! 

...And Cass had those things too. Emma clenched her fist, feeling a slight golden heat rise from her hand. She was still connected to the sun, though much more weakly than during the solstice. She could do magic now without ingredients, rituals, or spells. She just had to think of the effect and impose her will on the world. This kind of casting came with a downside, however, as it used her own energy rather than the innate potential of the carefully crafted rituals that normally accompanied spellcraft. Still... maybe, if she was careful, she could...

                            <span class="markdown">just sort of lean in and...

Emma kissed Cass, gently and only for a moment, remembering the sunlit warmth that had spread through her for that brief instant in the ritual chamber. She leaned back into her chair, exhaling wearily and clasping one of Cass’s hands in her own. Motes of golden light danced in the illumination from the window and found themselves pulled towards the site of Emma’s magic.

A touch of color returned to Cass’s face and she gasped. Her eyes opened, the pupils wide and unfocused for a moment before they snapped to Emma’s face. She held her breath.

“Emma,” Cass breathed, her eyes closing again. “I’ve had the strangest dream...”

Emma squeezed her hand tighter and felt a tear drip onto the bed sheets. She smiled. “Why don’t you tell me all about it,” she said. “After you’ve regained some strength.”

Cass murmured something approximating “okay” and her grip relaxed, hear breathing steadying into a more natural sleep.

Emma leaned back in her chair and tapped the nurse call button, ready to share the news. 

She had a feeling that everything would be okay, in the end.

                            <span class="markdown"><em>Conclusion</em>
Hey, thanks for playing! I hope you had as much fun reading this as I did writing it! I had a lot of trouble coming up with the ending for this story in a way that felt organic, a way that left some questions unanswered, and a way that felt less bleak than the classic “everyone dies, the end” that this sort of eldritch-abomination-summoning type event so often turns into. As you may have noticed, there are plenty of loose threads that didn’t get tidied up. What happened to Ben? What will the cult do now? Is Cass going to be okay? Where did these sunlight powers come from? What happened to the waif? You know, these sure sound a lot like these things called “plot hooks,” or “sequel bait.” Hmmmmmmm...

Anyway, what’s next?
To start with, if you have any questions or suggestions, or if you just want to discuss the story, feel free to do so! I’ll be answering questions about the process of writing this and a few hidden tidbits in <span class="mention">#story_discussion</span>. I’ll likely shy away from major unanswered questions, though, as there might very well be a part 2 in the future.
After that, we’ll be archiving the current <span class="mention">#story_updates</span> channel and creating a new one! I’ll be taking about a week to a week and a half break (basically sometime in the first or second week of the semester) during which I’ll post a set of new starting prompts for the next story. If you have a submission you’d like to nominate for a starting prompt, feel free to post it in <span class="mention">#story_discussion</span>. Prompts with a good amount of support will be added to the list of options. The new prompts will go up after a few days, then after the end of that break I mentioned, the next story will begin anew!

Thanks a lot for your support and engagement and I hope you stick around for the next one!
