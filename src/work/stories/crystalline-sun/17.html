                            "Entry 1. 26105678.<br>
                            Arrived on this strange planet yesterday. Everything is made of crystal. The higher-ups tell us it used to be a star, but I have a hard time believing that. Stars aren’t solid. <br>
                            They took us down into these rudimentary mines in carts, passing through a lush forest in some upper caves beforehand. We stored our belongings there, in the wooden hut we were told would be our home for the next four weeks. These caves are dark and silent, unlike those above ringing with life and foliage. Sometimes I swear I hear something pounding in the depths. <br>
                            We dug for the rest of the day, excavating in a carefully planned direction and carting the crystal back up to the surface for processing. It got much colder in the upper caves than the lower, except for in the forest. The surface is frigid except by the lake near the landing zone. <br>
                            I hope these four weeks pass quickly.<br>
                            <br>
                            Entry 2. 03115678.<br>
                            It’s been almost a week and we’ve made progress. Today we broke into a warren of twisting tunnels, most about as wide as my head. No one seems to be quite sure what they are, but there’s a lot less crystal to get out of the way now, so I hope they keep it up. <br>
                            The pounding is getting louder. I swear we’re digging right toward it. I don’t know what the company wants with it, but I’m sure that’s their goal. I don’t need to know. I just need my pay and to get out of here. <br>
                            Here’s to another productive week.<br>
                            <br>
                            Entry 3. 04115678.<br>
                            [A word that translates as Lord, God, Power, Light, or something similar]. Today was bad. Very very bad. Those tunnels, we found out what they’re for. Little spider things, sized between a normal spider and one of those big crabs we saw in the upper caves. The big ones are bad enough, darting at you and sticking you with their fangs. A few minutes later and you’re paralyzed. Then they’ll stand over their prey and fight off anyone who comes near with acid spit and the claws on their legs. <br>
                            But what’s worse are the little ones. Once a big one has paralyzed some poor victim, they’ll dart out of the tunnels, hundreds at a time, and rip them apart. First the eyes, always the eyes. Then anything else that sticks out. Fingers, toes, hands, feet, limbs, head. If a part is too big to eat, they’ll bite it off and a big one will drag it back into their tunnels. [The same word as above]. And all so silent. They make no noise, not at all. <br>
                            The company men sealed off the tunnel with a portable shield while they decide what to do. Half my team is gone. Several more were shipped off planet to grow new eyes if they’re lucky or be dumped on the streets if they’re poor. I can hear the beats even louder now, even in the forest. <br>
                            [The same word again].<br>
                            <br>
                            Entry 4. 07115678.<br>
                            They brought in a hazmat team from off planet. I didn’t see what happened. They have us working on the second shaft.<br>
                            <br>
                            Entry 5. 08115678.<br>
                            The higher ups declared it’s safe now and sent us back in. They had put up metal barriers to seal off all the visible tunnels and blasted a route past the end of the area. We’re back to digging towards the pulsing. I think the others can hear it too.<br>
                            <br>
                            Entry 6. 14115678.<br>
                            We broke through to a new area today. Something is wrong with gravity here, but no one seems to care. We broke into a large natural cavern and, when grading the floor to smooth it out, we broke through the ground. There’s a huge, massive, enormous pit beneath us. Down below, a black orb that I can only assume is the planet’s core slowly rotates. Occasional cracks in its surface shine blue light similar to the color of the crystal near the surface. <br>
                            When we reported our findings to the company men, they ordered us back to the second shaft again. I know the beats are coming from that core. I need to go there.<br>
                            <br>
                            Entry 7. 18115678. <br>
                            Only a week left on my contract. They brought in some machinery and set up an elevator. I heard the original plan was to use a-grav lifts, but as I mentioned, something is wrong with gravity there. I hear they might send us down to clear something out. I hope so.<br>
                            <br>
                            Entry 8. 19115678.<br>
                            They sent us down there. We entered through one of those cracks and it turns out that blue light was only around the entrance. The rest of the tunnels are dark. The pounding beat is incredibly loud. It demands I approach, or flee. Cower or strike. I can’t tell. It is of [A word that translates as Beyond, Void, Heaven, Hell, Infinity, or something similar]. <br>
                            They had us clearing the tunnels that were already there, sweeping up loose crystals and bones and sending them back up in the elevator. Something else is strange, though. I found a weird red crystal heart that didn’t match any of the other stones around here. I kept it and sent the normal load up the lift for the company men. I feel dizzy now. When I look at the heart I can hear the air, all buzzing and vibrating. It’s very disorienting.<br>
                            <br>
                            Entry 9. 21115678.<br>
                            Some of my team went missing yesterday, apparently. I’m not sure when or where. I still have that heart. It feels hungry. I feel hungry.<br>
                            <br>
                            Entry 10. 22115678.<br>
                            We found the end. It’s a gigantic stone door with five indentations the size of my fist. Three were already filled with red light. I regret my actions.<br>
                            <br>
                            Entry 11. 23115678.<br>
                            The door is open, I know it. If they would let me out of this prison, if they would just *see* why I did what I did, they would pay. It’s all "trial for murder" this and "quintuple homicide" that. They don’t understand. If they had seen that heart, *truly seen it*, they would know. They would have done the same thing. Those men had no lives, no families. No one will mourn them.<br>
                            <br>
                            Entry 12. 24115678.<br>
                            The door is closed. I don’t understand. All five symbols are filled with light. What else is needed? I can hear them behind me, coughing and dying. Good. Now for the rest. The Core beats just beyond the door. I don’t know if I am to embrace it or destroy it. The heart roars in my mind. <br>
                            <br>
                            Final Entry. 25115678.<br>
                            As I lie here dying, I know I have made mistakes. The door will open once I pass, I’m sure of it. I release the heart and with my death I will cleanse it. The next person to chance across it will *see* and they will have a choice. Unlike me. <br>
                            I can’t explain the choice. It will be obvious once past the door. I hope the company returns and seals this planet forever, though I know barriers have a way of undoing themselves. The Core will not rest until its heart has been returned to it, one way or another. It’s just the method of return that will make all the difference."<br>
                            <br>
                            You look up from your perusal. The blue crystal heart glitters innocently. You shiver, uncomfortable. Deep below, for the first time since you descended this far, you hear a heartbeat roll through the dead air of the Silence. <br>
