                <h2 class="tx-hammer">Who we are</h2>
                    <p>Our website address is: <a href="https://clockworksun.com">https://clockworksun.com</a>, hereby referred to as the Website or the Site. The Site is managed by Shaun Burriss, with technical support and hosting provided by the Clockwork Sun network. You may contact the website staff at <a href="mailto:contact@clockworksun.com">contact@clockworksun.com</a> and you may contact the webmaster at <a href="mailto:admin@clockworksun.com">admin@clockworksun.com</a>, specifying the name of the website (clockworksun.com) in your message.</p>
                <h2 class="tx-hammer">What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h2>
                    <h3>Visitors</h3>
                        <p>We collect no data from visitors to the website who do not log in, leave a comment, upload media, interact with embedded content, or otherwise actively provide us with their data.</p>
                    <h3>Comments</h3>
                        <p>We currently do not have a comment feature on this website. If one is added, this policy will be updated (2018-12-17).</p>
                    <h3>Media</h3>
                        <p>We currently do not have a media upload feature on this website. If one is added, this policy will be updated (2018-12-17).</p>
                    <h3>Contact</h3>
                        <p>If you choose to email one of the provided addresses, we collect and store the email address used to contact us, as well as any information provided in the message or contact form. This is done in order to efficiently respond to any comments or reports. Emails may be stored indefinitely to ensure we have context to respond to related correspondence.</p>
                    <h3>Cookies</h3>
                        <p>We do not currently set any cookies for visitors accessing the website. There may be cookies provided through linked stylesheets, and I am in the process of removing these. This policy will be updated once I have completed this transition (2018-12-17). Until then, those cookies are governed by the privacy policy of the site they belong to.</p>
                    <h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3>
                        <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the website from which the content is linked.</p>
                        <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website. We will attempt to make it obvious when content is embedded as opposed to local.</p>
                    <h3>Analytics</h3>
                        <p>We do not analyze any data you provide us except in order to better provide or improve the Websiteâ€™s services. No automatic analytics are performed with the exception of third party analytics if you choose to interact with embedded content as described above.</p>
                <h2 class="tx-hammer">Who we share your data with</h2>
                    <p>We do not currently share any data collected with any third parties, and will not share any data unless served with a legitimate US court order or similar legal proceeding. Data may be shared within the Clockwork Sun network, but it will not be shared with affiliated sites. See the <a href="/tech/hosting">Hosting</a> page for more details on the Clockwork Sun network.</p>
