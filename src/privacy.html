                <h2 class="tx-hammer">Who we are</h2>
                    <p>Our website address is: <a href="https://clockworksun.com">https://clockworksun.com</a>, hereby referred to as the Website or the Site. The Site is managed by Shaun Burriss, with technical support and hosting provided by the Clockwork Sun network. You may contact the website staff at <a href="mailto:contact@clockworksun.com">contact@clockworksun.com</a> and you may contact the webmaster at <a href="mailto:admin@clockworksun.com">admin@clockworksun.com</a>, specifying the name of the website (clockworksun.com) in your message.</p>
                <h2 class="tx-hammer">What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h2>
                    <h3>Visitors</h3>
                        <p>We collect no data from visitors to the website who do not log in, leave a comment, upload media, interact with embedded content, or otherwise actively provide us with their data.</p>
                    <h3>Comments</h3>
                        <p>We currently do not have a comment feature on this website. If one is added, this policy will be updated (2018-12-17).</p>
                    <h3>Media</h3>
                        <p>We currently do not have a media upload feature on this website. If one is added, this policy will be updated (2018-12-17).</p>
                    <h3>Contact</h3>
                        <p>If you choose to email one of the provided addresses, we collect and store the email address used to contact us, as well as any information provided in the message or contact form. This is done in order to efficiently respond to any comments or reports. Emails may be stored indefinitely to ensure we have context to respond to related correspondence.</p>
                    <h3>Cookies</h3>
                        <p>We do not currently set any cookies for visitors accessing the website. There may be cookies provided through linked stylesheets, and I am in the process of removing these. This policy will be updated once I have completed this transition (2018-12-17). Until then, those cookies are governed by the privacy policy of the site they belong to.</p>
                    <h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3>
                        <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the website from which the content is linked.</p>
                        <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website. We will attempt to make it obvious when content is embedded as opposed to local.</p>
                    <h3>Analytics</h3>
                        <p>We do not analyze any data you provide us except in order to better provide or improve the Website’s services. No automatic analytics are performed with the exception of third party analytics if you choose to interact with embedded content as described above.</p>
                <h2 class="tx-hammer">Who we share your data with</h2>
                    <p>We do not currently share any data collected with any third parties, and will not share any data unless served with a legitimate US court order or similar legal proceeding. Data may be shared within the Clockwork Sun network, but it will not be shared with affiliated sites. See the <a href="/tech/hosting">Hosting</a> page for more details on the Clockwork Sun network.</p>
                <h2 class="tx-hammer">How long we retain your data</h2>
                    <p>We currently do not collect data from visitors, so we do not retain it. This policy will be updated if this changes (2018-12-17).</p>
                <h2 class="tx-hammer">What rights you have over your data</h2>
                    <p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. This may take some time to collect all information, depending on how much you have provided, so please be patient. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for legal or security purposes.</p>
                    <p>You may request deletion of all of your data at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:admin@clockworksun.com">admin@clockworksun.com</a> and mentioning the name of the website (clockworksun.com) in your message. One of the Website’s staff will be in contact shortly afterwords to confirm your request for deletion and to begin the process. Please provide up to a week after confirmation to allow time for us to ensure none of your data remains on our systems. Another week may be required to ensure no data remains in our backups, and if we happen to restore from backup during this week, your data may be inadvertently recovered. We will do our best to avoid this scenario and will attempt to ensure all of your data is re-deleted. Please contact us if you think we made a mistake.</p>
                <h2 class="tx-hammer">Where we send your data</h2>
                    <p>We currently do not send any data to third parties. All data remains on our systems only. If this changes, this policy will be updated (2018-12-17).</p>
                <h2 class="tx-hammer">Additional information</h2>
                    <h3>How we protect your data</h3>
                        <p>All connections to this website are secured by SSL (https) so all data sent and received is encrypted and private, aside from the initial DNS lookup and handshake. If and when I decide to add logins, I will ensure all user passwords are salted and hashed, and never stored or transmitted in plaintext. I use a firewall, heuristic connection-blocking, strong passwords, and two-factor authentication - among other things - to ensure it's as difficult as I can make it to hack into the server this site runs on. I stay up to date on known vulnerabilities and keep the system updated to mitigate them.</p>
                    <h3>What data breach procedures we have in place</h3>
                        <p>If you have any information about a data breach or other security flaw in the Website, please contact <a href="mailto:admin@clockworksun.com">admin@clockworksun.com</a>, mention the website name (clockworksun.com) in your message, and provide as many details as you possess. We will immediately look into the problem and provide more information once we know more.</p>
                    <h3>What third parties we receive data from</h3>
                        <p>We receive no information about our users from third parties, with the exception of YouTube analytics if you choose to watch our videos either on this site in embedded form or on YouTube itself. YouTube, owned by Google, has a privacy policy located <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">here.</a></p>
                    <h3>What automated decision making and/or profiling we do with user data</h3>
                        <p>There are no decisions made on this Website without a member of Website staff directly involved in the process. If this changes, this policy will be updated (2018-12-17).</p>
